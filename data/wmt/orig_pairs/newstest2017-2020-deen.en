Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran's destabilising activities in the Middle East.
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution.
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years.
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process.
The relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran's atomic programme, .
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel.
In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.
This year, he was only teaching two online classes.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
He was quite the heartthrob back then.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.
Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country, down from the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month, with staff levels rising from October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it dawns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie starts and it occurs to me that I'm a fake yawn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis, and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "inarguably the greatest time travel movie ever put on film."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select movie theaters Oct.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's stepped up military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people.
The U.N. chief again urged all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are holding out for an implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.
And they are angry at Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."
Munich, Sylt und Co.: the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in Hobookenweg – with a view over the North Sea mudflats.
On this road one square metre of a thatched house costs an average of €73,300.
"On Sylt, the number of properties on offer is naturally limited," says a study – hence the high prices.
This new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square metre.
Of course, €18.70 per square metre for student digs in Munich is not really low.
Compared with Germany's top areas, however, this price seems likes peanuts.
Property service Engel & Volkers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with staggeringly high prices per square metre.
More than €10,000 is nothing there - per quare metre, mind you.
Ok, if you can't afford it...
Incidentally, for once Munich is not in the lead.
Champions League: Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll.
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for a 3:0 victory for FC Bayern at Olypiacos Piraeus - then it got better.
A confident start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze brought about a dream start to their "Milan Mission" in the seething cauldron at Pireaus.
Trainer Pep Guardiola's team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders, thanks to Müller's brace (52nd and 90th minutes +2) and Götze's goal (89th minute), ending in a score of 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016, where Guardiola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trophy back to Munich.
With his 28th goal in the Champions League, Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gracious help of Olymiacos goalie Roberto, who let through a cross shot from the world champion.
"We aren't going to underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Phillipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich player kept his word.
They demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being showy.
Piraeus had won their six most recent premiere class home games, including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United, Atletico Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund stumbled here too.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven Europa Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went to work boldly, but often too uninspired in their offensive efforts.
Attacks were too often initiated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got past former Brunswick player Omar Elabdellaoui, into play.
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal.
In the 67th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in the first half.
First when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole's header from the line in the 26th minute.
Then with a shot which the goalie parried with his knee in the 35th minute.
Although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game, Piraeus were able to needle them.
But they could count on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
For example when he steered a shot from Ideye over the crossbar in the 56th minute.
Guardiola had a four-man backfield defence deployed in front of Neuer, with David Alba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng.
Mario Götze, back in the squad following muscle problems, initially sat on the sidelines.
The world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training, said Sporting Director Matthias Sammer on Sky: "If anyone wants to make something else out of that, they are being malicious".
At the first change, Guardiola decided against him, when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the stricken Lewandowski in the 59th minute.
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal in the 76th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later; Müller put another one in with a penalty.
Before the match there was a riot in the stadium.
After a small group of Bayern fans, some wearing masks, had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Piraeus from behind their fence with words and gestures, security forces attacked them and used batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium.
Smokers at a greater risk of losing teeth
Smokers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth, concludes a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is: if you give up the risk decreases fast.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers.
The scientists monitored more than 23,300 participants.
The main reasons for tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE states.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, emphasise the authors.
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-smokers', declared lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.
People should be persuaded to become non-smokers, declared study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifespan".
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age.
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by toothlessness, according to the DIfE.
Earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long term study substantiates these findings.
Archaeologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
Archaeological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Archaeologists from the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Historians have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine.
The museum, as the department for archaeological monument conservation, is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne.
The archaeologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Boulevard.
It is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century, and in the 8th century a church, explained Trier.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves, which probably belonged to the church, has also been discovered.
Young woman hit by goods train
After a young woman met with an accident at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, police are asking for help from the general public.
Early on Wednesday morning, at about 1:40 a.m., the young woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal police she suffered severe injuries from the accident.
She was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by ambulance.
Investigating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night.
It is possible that the event was observed by witnesses or residents may have heard something.
This may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lindern station, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstrasse and Leiffarther Strasse (L364).
Any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police hotline on 0800/688 8000 or at any police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over TTIP
To defuse the controversy over the planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system.
According to this, the disputed private arbitration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system which citizens trust," stated the responsible EU Commissioner, Cecilia Malström, when introducing it.
The Swede plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government has announced its support.
The creation of TTIP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world, covering 800 million people.
Plans for reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come in equal proportions from the EU, the USA and from non-member countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also provided for.
This would allow for appeals to be made against judgements.
Up to now, the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitrator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their judgements.
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system to be fair and just, commented Malström.
In the long term, according to her statement, she wants to aim at an international investment court.
In this, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up.
Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), which is required particularly by large companies, is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the TTIP in Europe.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by adversaries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax payers, make national laws null and void, or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards.
In initial reactions, anti TTIP organisations such as Capact called the EU Commission's proposals inadequate.
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State for the Economy, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, referred to the plans as major progress.
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government, too, welcomed Malström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules.
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, they said.
When talks over the TTIP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been taking place since the middle of 2013.
The issue of investor protection, however, has to date not been discussed with the USA.
It was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year.
This date is no longer tenable.
Exquisite folk from Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club (now Luxor) in Cologne.
Beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy-seeming folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, some 40 people, is virtually mesmerised by Stevens's performance.
Referring to different places, which each time he marks on the map, he talks about the stories behind his meticulously and subtly contrived songs.
Where they originated, and what it looks like, in his home country.
Since then Stevens has proved himself to be a wonderfully creative nutcase.
His third album, "Greetings from Michigan: the Great Lake State", released in 2003, features cleverly composed songs which cling harmonically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late sixties, but which might drift at any time into amazing opulence.
Rumour has it that "Michigan" was the first part of a bold series: it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States.
But in 2004 in the Rhine area, "Seven Swans" came out, bursting positive expectations.
Stevens seems to have downsized here.
Playing live he only needs a guitar and banjo.
One year later the New York-based musician returns to his series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel The Illinoise") in 2005, a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released.
Exuberant with ideas and stylistic sophistication.
The album climbs the American Billboard charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then serves up "The Age of Adz" (2010), an elaborate electronic set piece.
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with a variety of effects and echoes.
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectacles with neon headbands and huge fluorescent stage decorations.
Currently Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-man band.
Hamburg Mehr kept in the dark!
Since March the theatre has primarily presented "Carrie and Lowell".
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit spellbound in their seats, the clearly more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to folk.
Without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one can hear: the performance is more "opulent" and it makes you want to "chuck away the album".
Only with his encore does Stevens give his modest thanks, play a few of his older songs acoustically and finally take a bow to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.
Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youngsters how to take photographs of their neighbourhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.
A deal would combine the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fallers on the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear firm reported an 83% jump in half-year pre-tax profits to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer extra jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital city: on a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
A ridiculous 21 years young, a wimpy kid with a too trendy haircut.
The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth a hundred million euros.
Probably even more.
At the moment Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the under-17 generation is going berserk.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
Not so bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Eva and Viktoria from Poland.
But the Poles have been sitting on the cold stone slab in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Potsdamer Platz since 7 o'clock in the morning.
The Bieber building: their idol, whose face appears on huge numbers of posters in Szczecin, has been staying here since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother Ewa earns in six months.
At least.
She says: "My Viktoria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the grammar school at the moment."
"I'm fulfilling her dream for her."
Compulsory education?
Who wants that?
Not the fans.
Nor Bieber himself.
He is financially secure anyway.
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bowl, a two-year deal with an anti-spot company pours many many dollars into Bieber's account.
And for every doll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bieber cashes in as well.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee people goggle through the window.
He has looted more than a hundred million like that.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others point out that after all Bieber is charting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose new album is due out in November, is not interested in all those zeros.
At least that's what he says.
Pegida poster suggests the idea of potato doner kebabs to Lebanese man
Potatoes or doner kebab?
You can have both – in the potato kebab that Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay has created.
Inspired by the slogan "potatoes instead of kebabs" on a Pegida movement poster, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a skewer.
A poster at a Pegida demonstration with the slogan "Potatoes instead of kebabs" which he happened to see on television gave him the idea.
Since then a spit laden with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop.
"That is multi-cultural food!" says Alhay.
Now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich.
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design.
Because of this, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the spit holds.
Just enough so that, "They taste much better together," he reckons.
Customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.
He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
But frustrations were on the rise.
As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.
As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.
More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.
But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Pleasant temperatures for bathing: the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
Even if peak levels are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water.
A dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Many people no longer go into the sea: the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees, according to the German meteorological office (DWD).
The Mediterranean, by contrast, offers suitable temperatures for bathing: in the east they are as high as 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic peak temperatures are 25 degrees, and in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.
By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.
And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.
"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Others injured will receive half that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise
Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening
At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home
If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move more towards a balance.
Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.
Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.
As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
Officials from Aich-Dob in court for breach of trust
Two officials from the Austrian volleyball runner-up champion team Aich-Dob attended the Klagenfurt regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax evasion.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position.
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current case was adjourned.
According to senior Public Prosecutor Robert Riffel, it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used monies from the club's accounts, to which they had access due to their roles, for private purposes.
The loss is estimated at around €400,000.
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
The Chairwoman of the Lay Judge Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin, ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed.
It will be tried at a later date.
On the charge of breach of trust, the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pecuniary disadvantage
The sports officials had only offset expense allowances, and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011, and in which they had invested much time and money, out of debt - liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 Schillings (around €44,000).
"At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down," said one of the defendents, who makes his living as an auditor of large companies for the tax authorities.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he had then resolved to undertake this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money and deposited our life insurance policies with the bank as security," he said during the examination.
It was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money, but they were not permitted to run up any debts.
Furthermore, if there was appropriate financial success, retrospective payment of the expense allowance back to 1991 was agreed.
As a result, a part of the expense allowance was paid off years later, that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit.
This is why general and not detailed debit entries appeared, was the former chairman's explanation for the processes.
The two defendants managed the accounts and passbooks together, said the second defendant.
The Judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements, it was only important that it should be debt free, was the answer.
When investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011, a sum of €120,000 was transferred into the club's account.
Those were reserves, explained the defendant.
This securities account was run in the name of the two defendants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club.
"Why?" the Judge wanted to know.
There was no answer to this for a long time.
Then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club.
Had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money, the State Prosecutor put to the room.
The co-defendant knew about it, the official justified himself.
The purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages.
"Why compensation for damages?" the Judge and the State Prosecutor wanted to know.
In response, the first defendant said that he had disagreed with this wording because no damage had ever occurred to the club.
But what can I do when the lawyer says, "This lets us all off the hook"?
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary, he had only charged for mileage and a per diem allowance.
The club had set aside €1,000 per month for per diem allowances, which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher, he added.
The defendants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years.
This was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed, they explained.
The second defendant had also obtained a mileage allowance.
All adjustments were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett Packard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years, the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the splitting of the company.
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP).
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to lay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its corporate customer section.
This should lead to cost savings of around $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company disclosed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a one-off charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred in the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 business year HP still employed around 302,000 staff.
At the end of trading Hewlett-Packard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent.
The group based in Palo Alto, California, which initially grew through its printer sales, is currently splitting its business: this year the computer and printer side will be combined in a new company, separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services.
Both operations will be listed on the stock exchange.
Repeatedly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently afflicted the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive layoffs.
The 76-year-old business headed by Meg Whitman has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online.
Whitman's plans for restructuring include around 55,000 job losses.
Conflicts: the majority support anti ISIS training mission
The majority of people, however, are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq: 54 percent were against it, 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour.
Sixty-one percent reacted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
Twenty-four percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Fifty-one percent of those surveyed are against cooperating with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, but 20 percent were in favour.
Twenty-nine percent were undecided.
Cars: Second press day at the 66th IAA
At the centre of the exhibition until 27 September are interlinked, self driving cars as well as electro-mobility.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition, whose motto is "Mobility Connects", on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers from the automobile Association VDA estimate that approximately 900,000 visitors, similar to 2 years ago, will attend.
Röszke: outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water cannon stood at the ready.
Between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers.
At first the officers used a continuous spray of pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
This caused the group to break up.
The group has now reluctantly withdrawn.
A pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area.
Children who have inhaled tear gas are screaming.
Other refugees have slumped down together and are suffering from respiratory distress.
The press spokesman for the Serbian police also sustained injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been performing relatively well, the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.
However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.
He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.
Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.
Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.

The actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008, he was busted for drug possession.

Eurowings: Lufthansa reconstructing group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group.
The Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone.
Reconstruction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs.
Meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is reorganising the structure of its business and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The goal of the realignment is a contribution to profits of around €500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business.
The Eurowings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the management board headed by Carsten Spohr.
With this new realignment Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Up to now the organisation of the 120,000 employees has been extremely complex.
The airline is consolidating the passenger airline group, which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion, under one umbrella.
New negotiations with pilots
Following the strike which was halted on legal grounds, negotiations with the pilots' union Cockpit (VC) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
Under discussion will be the pilots' retirement scheme.
"In a year with record results predicted" Cockpit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
The conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months.
Besides the pilots' transitional pension payments, the background is the "Wings" budget concept.
It proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa outsources to the group's own budget airline, Eurowings.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at PSV
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?
It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.
Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."
All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.
"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."
Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.
Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.
While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want.
In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is a fading force too.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.
It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."
The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.
The press never forgave him that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.
Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.
I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.
'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.
"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The adverts shaming Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Horrific killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance.
"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.

The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."
"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student halls
It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship
Introverts get a raw deal at university.
Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.
Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.
Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.
This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded by turning it up.
When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.
In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
Property entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the Middle Franconian town of Eckental for people who do not have much money.
For example for refugees – but also as a sign: "Not only refugees need accommodation, but also single mothers and people on low incomes."
"I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays," says the 44-year-old in an interview.
Thousands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market.
Entrepreneur Marcus Gildner believes he knows how quickly economical housing can be developed: with this project he is building terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market.
What solution are you offering?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers and gyms is not sustainable.
Because most of the people will be staying here.
We will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influx of refugees over the next decades.
A totally standard three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs little space.
It facilitates integration.
It is different when the people are housed in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, one bathroom, one kitchen and a lounge.
It's possible that many refugees will say; now that peace has returned I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted for different uses.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 m² of living space per house amounts to €184,000 without land.
That is manageable.
Construction took six months.
That is reasonable.
Did building regulations complicate your plans?
Gildner: I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations.
The sword of Damocles threatening special building projects, and parking space regulations, always make it complicated.
Scary.
It is still assumed that anyone creating three flats in a terraced house needs at least three parking places.
Except that there is not enough space in towns.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How have residents reacted to your terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers.
That is definitely not true.
But aren't you making the competition for affordable housing worse?
Gildner: The truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany, but it is luxury accommodation that has been built, which hardly anybody can afford any longer.
My project gives the message that normal people need housing space too.
Not only refugees need accommodation, but also single mothers and people on low incomes.
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays.
This is what it is about.
Marcus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: how to get new iPhone operating system, as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."
To get around that, users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down, or to try and upgrade through iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update, and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over.
It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.

You should also make sure that you've been through our checklist of all the things to do before you download, to try and stop things going wrong and protect against them if they do. iOS 9 brings new features including a much cleverer personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as tweaks that speed up and fix the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in his fight for the Formula One world championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The world championship runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races "that I've got nothing more to lose".
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday, 53 points divide the vice world champion from the titleholder and two times champion Hamilton.
The Brit has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floodlit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite.
In 2009 and in the preceding year the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet unclear.
A pall of smog has been hanging over the city for days, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The "Chess friends of Bad Kissingen" chess club, founded three months ago, has admitted another member to its ranks, taking the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is businessman Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who has stayed in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times for spa treatments.
Gauselmann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and is a freeman of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation which was accepted by chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
Youth work and talent searches can also be pursued.
Gauselmann wants his membership of the chess club as well as his friendly contact with the "Red-white" tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the spa town.
Accommodation office seeks face-to-face contact
Saludis and the Antonistift retirement centre have grouped together under the mantle of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to obtaining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there.
The social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre.
More precisely, to Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new accommodation office will be opening there shortly.
Here, directly next to the shopping centre, senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or the services of nursing and health insurance companies.
With our outpatient care service we have for years realised that family caregivers are often left alone.
This raises numerous questions.
"Not infrequently, too, many services provided by insurers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand," the new manager, Jutta Weigand, who as head of the services division for old people's welfare is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for "Amadeus" outpatient services, explained.
Apart from advice, the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention, health and wellness.
Saludis has been taken on board for this.
As a result, additional offerings such as prevention of falls, memory training or physiotherapy treatment are also available.
The offers from the senior citizens centre and from Saludis complement each other perfectly.
Saludis represents prevention, precaution, and rehabilitation.
"The senior citizens' centre for care and nursing," is how Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis describes it.
Both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centre as democratic change,
as this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
Furthermore, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the opening ceremony, the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people. "There are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend invitations to regular social gatherings".
Thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment.
The accommodation office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
It's now official: after the fixture for the FC Eintracht Bamberg match against third leaguers Würzburger Kickers could not be settled due to repair works at the Fuchspark stadium, the date has now been set for 6 October.
The meeting between FC Eintracht Bamberg and third league FC Würzburger Kickers in the last 16 of the Bavarian football pools cup is now finally scheduled.
The match will kick-off on Tuesday, 6 October at 7 p.m. in Bamberg's Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the match is going to happen; we can make plans now," says FCE team manager KarlheinzHümmer, confirming that ticket sales are now open.
It's something special for our team to be playing against a third league team.
We are hoping to get a large number of spectators, and not without reason, because floodlit games have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg moved into the last 16 with their victory against district league no. 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional league no. 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives €5000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB club cup 2016/2017.
The defending champions are SpVgg Unterhaching, who have been relegated to the third league.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, according to the Künstlerhaus on Tuesday.
In Meng the Künstlerhaus has lost an honourary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," it is reported.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Meng studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the second World War.
He worked from 1952 as a freelance architect, but was also a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasury chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the renovation of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at traffic warden
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese attracts the wrong sort of attention in Bremen
He was once a footballer but now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalie for Germany who also played for Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
According to him he wanted to put on 30 kg of muscle mass in the past two years.
On the other hand he hasn't put on any intellectual weight.
Wiese was just having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when outside he saw a traffic warden putting a penalty notice on his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese stormed out of the hairdressers, abused the officer and threw down the money for the fine at her feet, according to a report in the "Bild" newspaper.
The accusation has been confirmed by the town of Bremen but it is not yet known what the consequences of this extraordinary incident will be.
"The matter is still being investigated," says a spokesperson for the town of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wiese.

Men set upon 17-year-old Afgan
Police are seeking witnesses to an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster. At about 11.45 on Friday evening, three young men were walking from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
According to police one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him.
At this point the group were level with the bft petrol station.
Three people were standing on the petrol station premises.
One of these men shouted at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist.
This broke the victim's nose and his nose bled heavily.
One of his two friends ran to him and begged the attacker to let the victim go.
The injured young man was taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group to their home in a car and drove past it several times in an ostentatious manner.
As soon as they could no longer see the car, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by his original attacker and another male.
Using a club, they beat the victim in the face and upper leg.
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care.
Up to now there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One was a man of about 5ft 11in tall.
The second attacker was about 5ft 5in tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt.
Police are asking any possible witnesses to contact them by telephone on 0049 6181 100 123.
Dr Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests €310,000
Sylvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The mayor of the joint community, Bernd Bormann, business sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are delighted at this turn of events.
Many areas in the country have no doctor – Asendorf by contrast is fortunate: on 1 October Dr Frank Müller is taking over the Felstehausen practice.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will spend the next few months working part-time with his successor.
Dr Müller reopens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation; by then he will have invested €310,000 in the premises at St.-Marcellusstrasse 6.
When the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who at the time were finishing their residencies in Verden hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years, they liked each other immediately
"It was always in the back of our minds that the Müllers would fit into this practice well," says Dr Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When we were ready, I simply called them up."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know the families and support them over the years."
He also sees being his own boss as a benefit.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers would buy the house with the practice.
However in the meantime they are living in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Father of two Frank Müller also grew up there and after his medical studies in Hanover he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg und Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a consultant in Sulingen, furthermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the county of Diepholz in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (a specialist in internal medicine) specialised in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both specialists in internal medicine, wanted to establish themselves as general practitioners.
"So it's out with the endoscopy," says 38-year-old Sylvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress EKGs and we need one more consulting room.
The IT system will also be completely renewed.
The Müllers are receiving a grant totalling €50,000 as part of a funding programme from the county (€2,500) as well as from the joint community (€12,500) and the local authority (€12,500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on," stressed the mayor of the joint community Bernd Bormann.
According to Sylvia Müller-Gongoll, some 2,000 patients visit the Felstehausen practice every quarter; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500.
There is another GP practice in Asendorf.
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice: according to Ursel Felstehausen, the chemist will stay in Asendorf.
If they hadn't found any successor, it would have closed down.
Anyone visiting the Müllers' surgery will also first of all see familiar faces: they are taking over the seven medical assistants and the cleaner from the Felstehausens.
With their leaving, an era ends in Asendorf; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years.
"We started with only two rooms," remembers Ursel Felstehausen with a grin.
After such a long time she feels a little wistful.
"But we'll still be living in Hohenmoor and I'm sure we will be seeing many of our patients often," says the internal medicine specialist.
Her husband adds with a smile, "We've got a 6000 m² garden."
"Up to now I haven't done much gardening, that might change now."
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy travelling.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Border control is being brought in now on our southern border too," says Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
In parallel, checks on the Hungarian border remain in place.
It is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can "of course" do so.
The care and safety of people is paramount.
It is equally clear "that obvious signals are needed," says the minister.
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration, and not over the Austrian-Slovenian border either.
A controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a "corridor" - Slovenia has refused.
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany, and also potentially establish corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it in quite the same light.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Sloveina intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, as the external border to the Schengen area, is however already heavily controlled.
But as the Minister stressed, Slovenia is not suggesting sealing its borders for refugees.
"Every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing, in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby maize field.
Since then, according to local media, police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian Tavarnik.
They are mostly Syrian and Afghans, among them many women and children.
The emergency sevices and the Red Cross are also already in place.
Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days.
In addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border, are being diverted to Croatia
The government in Belgrade denied, however, that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes. "We neither can nor want to do that," they stated.
According to media reports, at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early hours, and in the course of the day more buses are expected.
Over Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The detainees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary is closed, so the police said we should come here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to go through Croatia, Slowenia and Austria to get to Germany.
This implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west, which observers have already predicted, could actually now be happening.
Croatia: "Widespread options for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He gave no details, but he indicated that Croatia, as a non-member of the Schengen Treaty, has "widespread options for border control."
Rigorous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schegen area.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned.
There are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to media reports from Belgrade, they spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
The Hungarian authorities claim that both the Horgos and the Backi Breg border crossings also remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear.
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning, the Serbian Interior Minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure people: he considers the debate on the refugees' alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be premature.
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes.
But private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger: in parts of the border region, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers has been sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok belonged to a ring of cyber criminals who since 2010 have repeatedly been accused of providing inside views of as yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The information provided enabled insider dealing on the financial markets.
By this means, according to investigators, a total of over $100 million was scammed.
"Current information indicates that even those outside our national borders have finally been caught," an SEC report states.
Proceedings against 32 other suspects in this case are continuing.
Most of the accused come from the Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators were operating out of both the USA and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Care celebrates 20 years in Mannheim
Business rules around the Paradeplatz in Mannheim
People carry out their errands, some of them walking briskly, some of them strolling along in a leisurely fashion.
They head for the two branches of the Mannheim car showroom.
Trams stop.
Pulsing, vibrant life in the brilliant autumn sunshine, and right in the middle are four big blackboards each bearing the words, "Before I die I want to…"
The Ecumenical Hospice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary, and is encountering extremely mixed reactions.
"It's about life, which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town, right among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of Ecumenical Hospice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with passers-by, as are voluntary workers.
While many passers-by impulsively grab the chalk and complete the sentence with "affirm my life", "be able to read", "drive through the USA in a camper van", "stop war" or "not suffer for long", others stop briefly, read, say things like "I'm not ready for that yet", and carry on.
Again and again little discussions develop in corners about the campaign itself, about life, about dealing with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also there now.
"It's only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live responsibly," says the Director of the Protestant social charity Diakonischen Werk in Mannheim, which is a responsible body along with the Caritas Association for Ecumenical Hospice Care.
Which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20-year-old organisation.
Of course it's understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the blackboards; in the end it's a very personal matter.
The topics of life and death are still steeped in taboos, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it.
A perception shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The volunteer worker, who helps people to deal with death and grief, has been with the organisation from the start.
Having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Care organisation appealed for volunteer helpers, she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households, hospitals, care homes and in the Sankt Vincent Hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is particularly well suited to handling this job and the experiences and everything it entails.
"I see life from a different point of view, I believe it is precious and I seize the moment," she says.
The outpatient services offered by the Ecumenical Hospice organisation are free of charge and denominationally independent.
Financial support from health insurance companies and donations by members enable education as well as training sessions, and training and supervision for palliative care providers and grief counsellors.
Training for new staff is offered every two years.
The blackboards, with the messages written on them on Saturday, are now on display in the Evangelical church (M1, 1a) and the Catholic church (F2, 6).
Anyone who wants to can also write their own personal wishes on postcards there.
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.
"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.
But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering an dizzying array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food stall (good, inexpensive) is near the registers, and has various takeout options.
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Items are reasonably priced, and a number of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more.
Who shops there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The find: Fresh monthong durian next to the checkout stand.
Where is it: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can get busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Hoyerswerda: a bit of help for refugees
These days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany.
To prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary helpers.
In Hoyerswerda there is also a whole range of people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the town.
Among these are Petra und Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a dedicated teacher.
Even at 74 she still loves teaching.
Every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on Dillinger Strasse.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diets
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.
Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
Bernried district council has approved the planning application for the €2.3 million sports hall.
And it is making an exception.
The roof may be flatter to accommodate a solar energy system.
Planning for the long-awaited sports building on the Bernried sports ground are moving ahead step by step: in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion.
The committee had earlier agreed, among other things, to an "exception", or rather an "exemption" under building law to the applicable building plan.
The "exception" refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure.
According to this a "gable roof with an off-centre ridge and roof overhang" will be constructed.
The background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels. "This means we will have a wonderfully large south-facing roof," explained mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "exemption" on the other hand refers to the roof pitch, which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipulations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees.
This will reduce the volume of the hall.
Therefore an "exemption" is necessary, since the development plan allows no "exceptions" with regard to roof pitch - while the Bernried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemptions.
The sports hall is however more of a recurring project. "We are not setting a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bernried.
Costs have been calculated at around €2.3 million.
Contributions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports.
In the next step of the project, the planning application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the district administration for review.
Peissenberg Clinic moves to Schongau.
The Peissenberg Hospital is closing earlier than planned – in 2016.
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The wards and the majority of employees are moving to Schongau from Peissenberg.
This allows for the district's limited company hospital's surprising plans, confirms district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiss.
The Board of Directors, however, will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If these plans are implemented, then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peissenberg will remain in employment.
The vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Schongau.
The premises are available.
Those employees who are not able to go to Schongau will be offered positions in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiss.
Employees have been informed about the plans.
The changes were triggered by the resignation of Dr Andreas Eder, who has been clinical director of the Schongau clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When the question of who his successor should be, according to Jochner-Weiss, the name of "Fischer", who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Schongau, was raised.
For the Schongau hospital, these changes mean an "upgrade" and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine, says Jochner-Weiss.
Fisher is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological disorders in its internal medicine department.
In the transitionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team, if the Board of Management agrees to this, will run both establishments, and in the next year the former miners' hospital in Peissenberg, which still has over 35 beds, will finally be closed after almost 140 years.
Thus far the district has planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing restoration of the Weilheim hospital is finished.
District administrator Jochner-Weiss, who is also Chairman of the Board of Management, contradicts rumours that the building, which is owned by the Federal Association for Miners, will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I can rule that out." What will happen to the building, Jochner-Weiss cannot say; that needs more consideration.
At the moment a Caritas short-term care facility and a daytime psychiatric facility are housed there.
"It's the best thing that could have happened for us; we won't get this sort of opportunity again," says Fischer about the move to the Lech, which has been accepted "positively and with understanding" by employees.
Real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist.
He was asked by his colleagues at Schongau to take over the post of medical director.
The Piessenberg hospital, which once had 100 beds, has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades. Departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of Rhein-Neckar Löwen are being challenged this evening (8:15 p.m.) at Bergischer HC.
The leaders of the Bundesliga are the clear favourites in Wuppertal, however there are no grounds for arrogance.
In the past season the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at BHC and they have some ground to make up there.
Two injured in hunting accident near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the maize harvest on Tuesday afternooon.
A number of huntsmen were in action on a corn field near Pratau (Wittenburg district) during the harvest, according to police.
After shots were fired, two men, one 63 and the other 22, suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospital.
The precise cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Criminal investigators are trying to determine the details.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatine the victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatine who has been missing since Saturday.
When questioned the 20-year-old admitted to having killed the teenager and thrown her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
Sixteen-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime.
The body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern the public prosecutor's office and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old suspect, who confessed to the crime and led investigators to the site where the body was found, was arrested also on Tuesday evening.
The 16-year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Rockenhausen.
In their search for the young woman, investigators initially found personal items belonging to the victim.
Interviews with the missing girl's circle of friends and acquaintances ultimately resulted in 20-year-old becoming a suspect.
The presumed perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
Under interrogation the arrested man confessed the police that he had killed the 16-year-old and thrown her body in the canal.
The 20-year-old will be brought before the magistrate on Wednesday; investigators have reduced the charge to one of manslaughter.
Further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The struggle for allocations in the German housing market began long ago.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are crowding into a market which in many large towns is already overburdened.
They are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes.
To supply the demand for affordable homes, 400,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020.
This is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the "Social Housing" federation of associations.
In comparison, 260,000 units were completed in this year in Germany.
This amounts to a shortfall of 140,000 homes.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation.
Many then push onto the housing market and stand in long queues in front of rental flats.
According to the German Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as tenants.
The negative development in the housing market, however, is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study points to significant failings in housing policy over the last year.
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year.
There is a current shortfall in urban areas of around 770,000 living units laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares.
Due to the slump in the housing market, young adults of necessity live longer in "Hotel Mama".
In large towns over the last few years, the number of square metres per head has decreased for the first time.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" alliance suggests a fresh start.
New incentives should revive social housing.
For example land transfer tax could be waived and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the association, attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary.
The KfW state bank's refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities.
On Monday evening, a good week after start of the programme, €184 million – more than half of the around €300 million which had been made available – had already been requested.
The project may now even be stepped up.
Refugees have safe conduct: Croatia and Slovenia put corridor in place
Since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through, the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia.
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles.
However the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Interior, and if necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister for the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the sealing off of the Serbian Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there.
Five hundred people came over the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had cordoned off its borders for refugees the previous day.
Moreover, new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explains, "They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility".
These people are there, they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something.
They are however people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports most come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived at the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and in taxis.
Immediately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border the refugees did not come across border fences.
The border strips hold other dangers: there are still active mines there from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 90s.
It is now planned for minesweepers to quickly create a safe passage.
Meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had picked up.
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws classify climbing and damaging the border fences as criminal offences.
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extradition from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new "transition zone" set up at the border, almost all – 93 – at the biggest crossing at Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there.
In practice, however, nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to opinion in Hungary, Serbia is "a safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by "the transition zone" in Röszke.
Workers have begun to clean up in Röszke.
They are collecting the rubbish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks.
Crowd barriers are being dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town is being rebuilt.
No one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria is getting only a few refugees.
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls.
According to the goverment, around 20,000 migrants are still in the country.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot.
Mayor drives "stranded people" over the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday, when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with suitcases," says Mayor of Wernstein Alois Stadler.
Tourists who wanted to get to Passau by train.
Because Germany had unexpectedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees, their journey had come to a halt in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and together with two other helpers and their cars chauffeured the stranded people over the border to Passau.
Before that we entertained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks.
We said at once that we would take them to Passau by car.
"It was a matter of course for us," says Stadler, talking to OÖN.
They were very grateful.
One man insisted on handing over a generous donation - €100 for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased about that," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had changed trains in Wels on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Passau after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended, in an attempt to cross the border anyway.
But the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, excursions over the border are generally very popular.
The Bridge Festival is a joint effort between Wernstein and Bavarians from Neukirchen; the Bridge Festival Association organises the social event on Sunday and an athletic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypocritical policies:
Instead of providing immediate help to the Röszke camp by constructing structures which ensure a level of humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government's stance closer to an atmosphere of national socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy.
Those who have fled, too, must notice that the "promised land" which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp.
It will be a huge challenge, in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for asylum seekers.
There is a still greater one - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad is looking for winter-proof accommodation for 35,000
Konrad has his hands full with the hosting of refugees.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government has engaged the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got to grips with the chaos in the Traiskirchen reception centre.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first achievement.
And the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great fuss, said Konrad, praising the organisational "masterpiece".
The Minister of the Interior, however, talked of a "critical situation".
In total, Konrad estimates that accommodation for 85,000 will be required in the current year.
In order to meet this figure, accommodation for another 35,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can manage.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," says Konrad.
He has already carried out talks with the State Governors.
They have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive.
"It is going well in Austria," says Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatary is assisting Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator has also got high expectations of the ORF "Help the way we are" campaign.
Private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform.
It is also hoped that this will include hotels, which are often empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday critisised the specifications for accommodation as "too high".
In times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain heights for towel rails or sizes of skylights.
"Emergency standards" should apply for a limited period.
Konrad uses his experience as justification for why he, in contrast to the Ministry for the Interior, should be successful with the accommodation.
I am an older man, and nobody readily tells untruths to my face
His most important weapon is the power of persuasion.
Konrad and Maier are not costing the Republic anything, as they themselves explain.
The want to raise the number of their staff from three to four.
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office.
But apparently there are problems with obtaining approval.
Linz demanding a better allocation
For the time being the city of Linz is not planning to open new sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena or the Design Centre as accommodation for refugees.
At the moment this should not be necesssary, as the people in question can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
But in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their suitability.
The town chief is criticising the allocation of refugees within the federal states.
Other districts should also make their own contributions.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be cordoned off"
In a long telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), State Governor Josef Pühringer(VP) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be cordoned off.
The onward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible.
However appropriate border controls do now exist.
There will now no longer be any special trains with refugees travelling to Germany.
Those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states.
The fact that Austria is also now reintroducing controls at its borders is for Pühringer "a logical consequence" of Germany's approach.
The next Runtastic is only a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neuen Werft" in the Lintz industrial area is officially finished.
The publicly listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building. It is planned that the rest (2700 m²) will be rented to young, innovative businesses in the technology sector.
"In IT clever heads are our raw material – and we must try to get them to work for us," says S&T boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in start-up businesses in Neuen Werft, and also later acquiring these.
S&T wants to collaborate with the new neighbours from the start – and Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
SMT is investing €1.7 million in the location and €3.3 million is coming from Techcentre, a third of which belongs to each of the town of Lintz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcentre for 60 years.
Thirty percent of the remaining 2700 m² in the building is already rented out and there have been enquiries about the other 40 percent.
Owner of Lia Peroni opens second business in the arcade.
In the new shop the focus is on Furla handbags.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old proprietor of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade had to unceremoniously postpone this plan: now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
In the Furla shop opposite the business where she sells among other things bags, cases, shoes and garments from different manufacturers, everything now revolves around Furla women's handbags; purses can be obtained starting at €75.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to €500.
The new shop opened yesterday.
It has been converted over the last few weeks.
"I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop," says Breit.
Crucial for this decision was among other things that the Furla manufacturers, who are based in Bologna, were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only people in the greater Lintz area who sell this brand," said the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Breit got her interest in fashion from her mother, when she was still in the cradle.
It suits me best if something emerges and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
The expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag.
Perhaps it's because a beautiful handbag can enhance any outfit.
The braggart from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as braggarts.
This characteristic also connects many with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always the source of controversy.
Whether he is expressing xenophobic opinions, being rude to journalists or revealing gaps in knowledge on crisis politics, the US presidential candidate creates a stir in the election campaign.
And comes out of it well.
This is also something that happens in the Palatine town of Kallstadt, from where the property billionaire's grandparents originate.
The New Yorker with the blow-dry hairstyle is a concept to many in the winemaking village on the wine route.
Many in the village of 1,200 inhabitants are related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatine: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
Simone Wendel, a resident of Kallstadt, has made a film about Trump.
And what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it rather exciting, but also in the way of Kallstadt people they are not deeply impressed.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous offshoots, included in whom besides Trump are also the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for his modesty, also gets a chance to speak in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway, even had he lived in Kallstadt.
He has not won over the people there.
There is indeed a certain respect for his family's achievements, but there also tends to be a view that Trump "is a bit of a bigmouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, Kallstadt's nickname in the region is, "Die Brulljesmacher", a dialect term which translates as "The Braggart", she says.
Trump comes from the village of the braggarts.
The story of the Trumps' success began in 1885 when the man who would become Donald Trump's grandfather emigrated and opened a saloon for gold prospectors in the USA.
The foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York.
But his grandparents' lives were not free of tragedy: their wish to return permanently to their home country collapsed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatine then belonged.
They would not let Trump enter as he had originally left without authorisation, the Director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Cultural Anthropology, Roland Paul, explains at the beginning of the film.
Trump is the grandson of "illegal emigrants".
This is at odds with the sometimes pithy statements of his descendant.
He has repeatedly spoken in derogatory terms about Mexican immigrants in the US, and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants.
"The fuss he makes about it is not very nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("My grandmother was born a Trump, my grandfather was born a Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American as rather aloof, "he always has a short fuse".
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine it," says the 72-year-old.
"He has never had any interest in Kallstadt."
Guest house landlady Veronika Schramm, like many of Kallstadt's inhabitants, mentions that descendants of the Heinz family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited, which was very well received.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
She would prefer it if he doesn't win the election as "he has such radical opinions, I don't know whether it would be a good thing".
If anyone like him had been in charge in his grandfather's time, "he would never have gone there".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"He's certainly not my president," she says.
And, "the grapes will ripen without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump gave a lengthy interview, has been seen by 12,000 cinema-goers, and interest is also growing in the USA.
The Upper Bavarian district of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Mountaineers' Village".
The village of 1,800 inhabitants in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for "Gentle Tourism" from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfenning, on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "Mountaineers' Villages" in Austria.
In our neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the distinction.
A "Mountaineers' Village" is permitted to have a maximum of 2,500 residents.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today.
Nine's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children, averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really down to earth, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
For her part, Mackay said last week's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.
And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's wealthiest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, seized and his pro democracy efforts curtailed.
Because of the large number of refugees, the Freie Wähler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bavaria.
At the start of the FW autumn conclave, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new schoolchildren: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will have upheavals in the Bavarian education system."
The Freie Wähler faction is in session in the Lower Franconian community until Friday.
Very different main topics were originally planned.
But the record number of refugees is dominating the Freie Wähler meeting too.
"Of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conclave," says Aiwanger.
Aiwanger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria, similar to the one during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties.
"It can't go on like this, we have to get to the causes," says the Freie Wähler head.
The Freie Wähler want to deport failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also wants more personnel for the adminstrative courts, which are responsible for asylum cases: "We need at least 50 new asylum judges as well," says Aiwanger.
The FW head criticised the lack of consistency between several federal states: "We need unified standards in the Federal states nationwide."
"Bavaria deports; others don't."
"We must be more efficient."
However, regional politics in Grosswahlstadt should not be allowed to suffer.
An issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda: educational policy.
In the new school year the Education Minister, Ludwig Spaenle (CDU), started a "middle school plus" pilot project, in which an extension of the middle level in grammars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry qualification exam.
But that is not enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 issue must be speeded up," says the FW head.
We demand freedom of choice for all grammar schools that want it.
A free move to G9 everywhere it is wanted.
Stronger Wall Street gives Dax a helping hand
After an over-long stretch of aimless and edgy trading, the German stock market has closed with gains.
It was only in the afternoon that a stronger rally on the US stock market provided a clearer direction which ultimately lifted the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The value of MDax medium size companies gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1,736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50, the benchmark index in the Eurozone, moved ahead by 1.01 percent to 3,207.60 points.
The markets in London and Paris also registered solid gains.
In the USA the Dow Jones index closed at about 1 percent up.
Many brokers reckon that markets will remain static until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also the major maturity of the futures exchanges this Friday.
Discussion about the impact due to the phasing out of nuclear energy has meanwhile pushed RWE stocks to an all time low and also left a significant mark on Eon.
According to the "Spiegel", the German energy companies potentially lack €30 billion in reserves.
The German Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press.
Stocks in the two largest German energy businesses have subsequently recovered somewhat, although ultimately RWE lost 3.31 percent and Eon 6.15 percent.
Infineon shares climbed to the top of the Dax by a further 3.22 percent.
In the view of one trader, a positive report by US investment magazine "Barron's" at the weekend continues to have an effect.
According to him investors in the German chip manufacturer are currently paying too little attention
Thus investment in the promising wafer technology and a focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car stocks were in demand: even in the traditionally week summer month of August, again more cars were sold than in the previous year period, as the manufacturers' association Acea disclosed at the start of the International Aotomobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
Stocks for car manufacturers Daimler and BMW, Opel and Fiat gained by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Stocks on Volkswagen increased in price by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the current yield of listed Federal Government securities fell by 0.48 percent (on Friday 0.50 percent).
The Rex bond index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
Government futures lost 0.71 percent, going down to 154.11 points.
The rate of the Euro sank in the afternoon, ending at $1.1262.
At around midday the European Central Bank had set the reference price at US $1.1305 (1.1268).
This means that the dollar cost €0.8846 (0.8875).
4 Killed After Police Fire Rubber Bullets at Protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday.
Contruction area planned in the town
The plot of land at the Alte Post youth centre in Emden is going to be built on again.
The town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square metre area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far.
Emden - The town of Emden wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations are currently underway.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
A spokesperson for the town states that it is awaiting suitable offers.
The identities of possible investors are not yet clear.
Consequently, no contract has yet been concluded.
The town of Emden sold a part of the site, situated on the Ringstrasse/corner of Grosse Strasse a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demolished.
Hieve project: facts are in the open
Plans for the holiday home development at the Kleines Meer near Emden are taking shape.
Investors have presented their plans for the project to the public.
A number of residents are again concerned – they are worried about the sale of their leisure refuge.
Plans have been negotiated, mulled over, debated, and plotted behind closed doors for months.
Now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kleines Meer near Emden are in the open.
The interested party, the Emden company "System-Bau", presented their plans to the Emden Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening.
Originally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public.
Under pressure from critics of the project and from the FDP faction, who had accused investors and the administration of secretiveness, Ralf Behrends of the System-Bau management went on the offensive. "We don't yet have an answer for all the questions," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spectators.
But it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now.
The €10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building provoked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting,
Roberto Schulz, property owner and member of the board of the residents' lobby group, Pro Hieve, claims: "It's going to be a huge development which looms over all the other buildings".
Furthermore, like a number of other critics of the project, he is afraid that traffic will increase enormously due to the proposed size of the facility. "We have to reckon with whole busloads arriving," said Schulz.
However it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hectare sized area of the former restaurant.
No operator has yet been identified.
"First of all we have to present a coherent concept," says Ralf Behrends.
Since this does not yet exist, construction plans are still subject to variation.
Twin gorillas born in Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurt Zoo is celebrating the birth of two gorillas.
Twenty-six year old Dian brought twins into the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare for gorillas.
The last time it happened in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago in 1967, also in Frankfurt, according to the zoo.
The sex of the new-born gorilla twins is not yet certain as so far mother Dian has kept a close hold on them.
First reported in the "Bild".
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google launches donation-matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a donation-matching campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog.
Rather than having an executive make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely driven by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.
Love story set in Hunsrück
It is a theme being used increasingly in fiction nowadays: a young woman, plain and unpopular when she was at school, meets her teenage crush years later and he falls in love with her.
This is what happens in the recently published novel "We're not really like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story itself, the novel may be of interest to every reader in Hunsrück as it is set in Langweiler and the surrounding location.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy to have been able to create a literary monument to her native area.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.
Villingen-Schwenningen: three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver received minor injuries in a collision on the cross-over between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove onto the cross-over in the direction of the industrial estate roundabout and realised too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result he ran into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle into the Ford Fiesta stopped in front of it.
Damage amounting to around €10,000 was suffered by the vehicles involved, according to the police.
The Audi belonging to the 33-year-old could no longer be driven and had to be towed away.
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony

Hearts to fight SFA over Neilson charge and Warburton wary of January signings disrupting squad unity
Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"
It is because Rangers aren't there.
People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games.
I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.
To stay together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.
The squad is doing really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years, and failed to find a move away from Wales in the summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - the third Collum red card in eight months to be rescinded.
Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."
Tannadice board has faith in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has faith in the management team to turn things round - but concedes the on-field decline must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys ready to go again," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's not a team out there who has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, who haven't won games like that."
Scots unemployment remains unchanged as UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's rate of 5.5 per cent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three month period, with the number of those in work now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling.
Drunks create a disturbance
Since security personnel could not appease the situation, employees called the police.
Officers were only able to take the troublemakers into custody after using pepper spray.
A breath test showed that a 16-year-old had a blood alcohol level of 0.89.
The teenager was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old with a blood alcohol level of 2.15 was initially detained in custody.
Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man's bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "coax him gently back to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins ditched his car to avoid a booze bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue-in-cheek Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.
It had it on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.
It is a joke.
People making these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram man, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.
"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: driver's cab torn apart
A lorry driver was seriously injured in a collision between three lorries on the A5 motorway near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three lorries involved had braked approaching long-term roadworks in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed too late and tried unsuccessfully to swerve left at the last moment, according to police.
The cab of the driver responsible for the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe North was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.m.
Damages amounted to €122,000.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.
Traffickers move towards Germany over minor border crossings.
More and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Due to fear of discovery and people being arrested, many traffickers are leaving
through minor borders on the Austrian side, says a spokesperson for the Federal police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of Inn in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had arrived on foot over bridges and weirs on the German side.
They are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration.
According to reports from the Federal police, significantly more refugees arrived at the main railway station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. about 700 people had arrived in the capital city of the state, said a spokesperson in the morning.
Following the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian borders, 1,759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: tail end of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the south west
Meteorologists are warning of squalls in the south west from Wednesday evening onwards.
Due to a depression over western Europe at the moment, warm sea air is flowing into the country, the German Meteorological service (DWD) has advised.
The powerful trough is the tail end of tropical storm "Henry", which has moved over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the last few days.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are anticipated, particularly in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour can be anticipated on the Swabian Mountains and in Bodenseekreis.
On Friday the sun is forecasted to put in a longer appearance once again
The chassis makes the difference: every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IAA
In 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars, which are selling especially well at the moment.
Compact class cars are currently very much in demand: according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport (KBA) about 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone belonged to this segment.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
In among all the futuristic concept vehicles and the new high-end and luxury models, this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car sector here is the Opel Astra, which hits the car dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It is at the heart of the brand.
To ensure that it sells well, the price of the new Astra is not increasing significantly.
Opel proposes an entry point below that of its main competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at €17,650.
The latest Astra costs from €16,990.
With a new 1.4 litre engine, the Astra has an output of 74 kw/100 hp.
The Hessian manufacturer also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 kw/95 hp to 147 kw/200 hp, including the first three cylinder petrol model.
Unlike its most important competitors, VW Golf and Ford Focus, for the first time the Opel Astra is only available as a five door.
In spring the estate car, already seen at the IAA, will follow as the second option
And what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competitor to the Astra, the Mégane, into the race.
The Mégane can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-door, in a conventional and a distinctly sporty version.
It will be available in dealerships at the beginning of next year, then also as an estate model.
Infiniti: the Infiniti Q30 is brand new in this segment.
The Nissan offshoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits right into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kw/122 hp.
A diesel with 80 kw/109 hp or 125 kw/170 hp is also on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: also new in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
On offer is the petrol engine model, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a performance of 82 kw/111 hp.
According to the manfacturer's specifications, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
The Baleno is launched in Europe in early 2016.
DS4: not totally new, but completely redesigned, is the DS 4 compact car model, which can be seen at the IAA.
The designers at the classy Citroën offshoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end: here the radiator grille has been newly designed and the modified headlights have been equipped with LED technology.
In the interior the infotainment system in particular has been modernised, the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple's CarPlay has been incorporated.
In the compact class the IAA also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mercedes A Class or the Peugeot 308.
JVA Berlin Tegel: five-square-metre cells are unfit for human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court has upheld a complaint by a former inmate of Tegel prison that he had been housed for months in too small a cell.
In principle, prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small.
The Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday.
According to the judge, those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days (ref: 1 BvR 1127/14).
For this reason a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe. He was detained in Berlin Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres: the toilet was not in a separate room.
Afterwards the man, who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released, was transferred to a larger cell.
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of unsuitable prison conditions however, failed.
But the constitutional judges set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and resubmitted the case there for renewed assessment.
In their view the human dignity of the man had been violated.
The Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages.
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in custody are significant for compensation, entitlement to a claim for compensation exists.
Otherwise there would be "fears of deterioration of a person's right to protection".
The Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pecuniary compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
As recently as April they awarded damages to a prisoner because he had been locked in his cell naked.
A cell with multiple functions and without a separate toilet is also inhumane, according to a decision from 2011.
Furthermore Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday that in addition, according to the Berlin Constitutional Court, a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 had attested to inhumane accommodation
The prisoner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karlsruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff.
Because of this, prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness rises and it has even led to brawls due to the tense situation.
According to information from the press office of the public prosecutor, 21 positions in Tegel have not been filled due to a lack of young people, and 19 will cease to exist in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can handle it"
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge – the German Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What changes will we see in Germany?
According to the predictions of the Federal Minister of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year, and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge. "I say again and again: we can handle it, and we will handle it".
The following is a summary of what is coming to Germany.
According to various forecasts between 350,000 (estimation by the Ministry of buildings) and 400,000 (estimation by the Pestel Institute) homes will be needed annually – and in fact for the next five years.
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment (250,000 homes).
The lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties: between 60,000 and 80,000 social dwellings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes.
Federal building minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) thus wants to double funding from the current €518 million to €1 billion.
In the view of the Pestel Institute this is far too little: 80,000 social dwellings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of €6.4 billion per year.
Academics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work.
However the refugees in Germany are not being systematically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started, criticised Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and training in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society, and also to the self-esteem of the immigrant says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, a political shift has taken place in Germany: from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work.
While in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years, this was reduced in November 2014 to three months, as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of domicile.
As far as the majority of society is now concerned, particularly in view of skills shortage, refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market.
One big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language.
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work-related language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact.
Thus, in Thränhardt's view, the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kindergarten; an estimated one to 15 percent. "For the uprooted parents their first priority is to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Senate administration.
To be able to convince families of the benefits of kindergartens, the administration is issuing leaflets in a number of languages.
If the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity, for example by allowing for more technical colleges.
In the states, pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes.
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of these, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying – the only exception up to now was Berlin: Senator for the Interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has however now abandoned his stance.
Refugees who want to study may have their entrance to university facilitated.
Refugees with a residence permit or protection against deportation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study.
In principle the latter receive no grant, as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant.
Tolerated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant; from 1 January 2016 this period is reduced to 15 months.
But this financing gap must also be closed, claim Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German student services.
The students should receive a grant immediately.
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-church law should be developed into a state-religion relationship.
The founding of an Islamic welfare organisation, which looks after new arrivals in a professional manner, is also important.
Rights also involve responsibilities.
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to concede certain control options.
This also requires the readiness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany.
Those who want to wage such conflict in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He suggested translating this basic law into Arabic.
In the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today.
This means too that mainstream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent.
For nearly 10 years, as a result of European rulings, Germany has had an anti-discrimination agency and a general equality act.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series shows, that racist motives are systematically ignored in the police and the authorities.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and non-white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time, and to which international treaties such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed, must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens – for the good of everyone.
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now, is the opinion of the president of the Doctors' Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can cope," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However extra money must be added to the system for this.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asked for all new arrivals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register.
Services provided can be accounted for with the Federal states later.
And in the long term it is highly doubtful that so many people can be fobbed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Benefits for Asylum Seekers Act provides.
Apart from this, doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier.
Up to now, as Berlin health researcher Thea Borde has established, migrants have received poorer information about their illnesses than other patients.
Interpreters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors' practices, she demands.
But many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine drop-in centres in emergency rooms.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Refugee children for example clearly suffer from more untreated disabilities, and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV.
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns, said Montgomery
"Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not that difficult to recognise." And because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors.
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors.
To be allowed to practice, however, they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exams.
In the estimation of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Association (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most of them are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A soon-to-be published study by the TU in Munich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatised in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called flashbacks, difficulties in breathing, dizziness, palpitations and fear of death.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, nervousness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, explained Munz.
Up to now, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Mentally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psychotherapy, but processing usually takes several months.
In addition, it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This frequently leads to false assessments, says Munz.
The ring invites you to dream
With their new "Passion" production, Circus Probst is returning to the traditions of the art of the circus.
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mesmerising acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now Circus Probst is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Ziegelwasen.
"Our passion is our circus."
"I couldn't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior manager.
"Passion" - this is the motto for the current production in the ring.
The circus has been owned by the Probst family for over 33 years.
The family has the gift of enthralling people in their blood.
"It's important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old junior manager.
Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept a "Cocktail in the ring with a cosmopolitan flair".
Fifty towns have the chance to experience this flair on the almost 3000 kilometre-long tour.
The circus programme wins people over with talented artists from all over the world.
Distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown family captivate the public with wit and charm.
The Castillo brothers, too, know their craft.
The Cuban duo are ready to compete with the heroes of silent films.
Lightness and agility - these words sum them up.
Their humorous artistry on the pole will win the women's hearts.
Apart from causing numerous bursts of laughter, the Circus Prost's acrobats are also mesmerising with their finesse and suppleness.
Balancing on a ball with a unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Contortionists enthrall and terrify at the same time.
Wang Lin, from China, is better acquainted with the oldest form of acrobatics than most and thrills with his flexibility.
Sixty entertainers from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," insists Staphanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Different animal welfare organisations all too often complain about mistreatment of circus animals.
Stephanie Probst has her own answer to this: "If our animals aren't happy, then nor are we".
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every bit of attention.
The "four-legged artistes" as they are affectionately known, have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible.
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go in the ring either.
So the top priority is to look after the animals well.
The Probst family are especially proud of their zebroid, Jumbo - the offspring of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"Then suddenly there was our little Jumbo," says Brigitte Probst.
But the zebroid is not yet ready for the ring, instead he is a unique little mascot for the Circus Probst.
There is something for every visitor.
"One thing is for certain," says Stephanie Probst, "regardless of whether there are five or 1,200 people in the audience, we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts.
Circus Probst invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
The programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday.
Thursday is family day; there is a discount on the price of the show.
And the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
"The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it's titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate.
The chief whip said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts at it enterprise services business.
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7bn, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50bn in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions" to companies, according to a company statement.
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get over that.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.
In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.
Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.
And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.
It augurs well.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan.
London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week revealed the $2.5-billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $30 billion debt pile by about a third.
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half, as coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon 49 people reach the municipality of Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six month old girl from Syria.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening, after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car rented and written off
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfil a dream and rented a Ford Mustang.
He got a rude awakening on the wet motorway.
A company in the district of Gotha allows you to fulfil your dream by renting out and driving an American V8 Ford Mustang Boss 302 440 hp sports car.
So the 29-year-old from the Gotha district did just that.
The end of his dream came on the A 71 motorway near Arnstadt.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into a skid on the wet road and drove into the crash barrier.
The sports car was a write-off but no one was injured.
Damage is estimated at €40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
A few years ago, FC Bayern was apparently close to committing to Spain's superstar Xavi, who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice club world champion, twice European champion, one time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breath-taking.
In the summer the then 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-Sadd Sport Club.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"At the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren't," he says.
And FC Bayern noticed that too.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
A quick reminder: in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over at FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not transfer.
The transfer never happened.
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why. "Barça had signed on Guardiola and I played a brilliant European Championship."
"Pepe told me that I shouldn't transfer, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have turned out if Xavi had left.
Xavi covered the entire distance on the turf for Barça in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bayern, knocked the Reds out (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the premiere class triumph.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.
Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.
So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He's received tons of accolades from fans.
He's such a great guy, and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Hundreds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hesse.
They are expected to arrive by Wednesday night.
The people who have travelled there will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, according to a statement made by the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening.
They estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive.
A number of sports halls in the Hessian capital have been prepared for this eventuality over the last few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these.
After this they should be redistributed to other communities.
According to a statement by the regional council of Giessen, responsible for their initial reception, 7500 people have arrived in Hesse in the past ten days alone
Due to the large number of refugees, emergency shelter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Hanau.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility.
"I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European nations of "collectively looking the other way".
Four years ago one would have been happy for the chalice of military involvement to pass Germany by.
"Now the conflict has come crashing down at our front door," he said on the German World Service.
The former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees.
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, stated on the Austrian television channel ORF on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary.
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that is the agreement," she confirmed.
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria, Mikl-Leitner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany.
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
Over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route.
Most of them are heading to Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, together with a number of other EU states and heads of government, are proposing a special summit for next week.
On Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls.
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory redistribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the heavy influx of refugees into Germany, the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people.
The Federal government will manage this jointly with the states, announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor's office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it.
But those who have no prospects of permanent residency will not be able to stay in Germany.
This opinion is also clearly generally shared.
The Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route.
On Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia.
A few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to seal off the border with Romania with a fence.
Unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers finding alternative routes through Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fences.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
The first arrests of people who had breached the fence have taken place.
In Turkey meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders.
"Cassini" space probe finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the icy crust of Saturn's moon Enceladus splashes a global ocean.
Scientists have deduced this from observing the "Cassini" space probe
This is the reason the moon wobbles slightly in its orbit of the ringed planet.
This wobbling is only minor, but nevertheless too much for a solid celestial body, it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Cornell University in Ithica in the US state of New York.
The scientists have published their findings in the "Icarus" scientific journal.
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under Enceladus's crust of ice.
"Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes, which spew water vapour and ice particles that feed the so-called E ring of Saturn, at the south pole of this moon in 2006.
Astonomers concluded at the time that there had to be a subsurface sea at least at the south pole.
The extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear.
Rama absent from 1860 Munich for several weeks
1860 Munich must do without attacking midfielder Valdet Rama for about a month.
An examination revealed that the 27-year-old has suffered an adductor injury, the club revealed.
Rama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably a four week compulsory break".
"It's hit us hard. Rama is a bitter loss."
"We have to think about it of course," Sports Director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper, regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club.
However the next training guest the sexagenarian is due to present is a defender.
Thirty-year-old Hrvoje Cale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to VfL Wolfsburg.
At the moment the Croatian has "the opportunity to prove himself".
Following his concussion, goal scorer Rubin Okotie is returning to training with the team in the coming week.
The Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday.
Okotie sustained a head injury in a violent collision in the match with Fortuna Dusseldorf (0:3).
Contrary to initial fears, however, the wound was not serious.
Not a diet fruit – mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic, juicy and sweet.
But anybody watching their waistline should avoid them.
Because mangoes have a relatively high sugar content – primarily sucrose.
The exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But most of all mangoes are full of vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
Eating the fruit boosts the sight, immune system and the body's metabolic processes.
When buying mangoes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant aroma.
It is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ripe the fruit is – even green mangoes can taste delicious.
They should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
They are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch even to savoury dishes.
They mitigate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radicchio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
US parcel service UPS is again taking on up to 9,500 temporary staff for its Christmas service in the USA.
The company has already started to recruit seasonal workers, UPS reported on Tuesday.
We are loooking for drivers in particular.
In the past few years, UPS increased its workforce by 9,500 for the four day season.
In light of booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have for several years been making provisions earlier in order to be prepared for Christmas business.
In 2013 there was harsh criticism of late deliveries by the parcel service.
First a foehn storm, then a pronounced cold front
The foehn will break through in the valleys on the northen side of the Alps in the coming night, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
The foehn will blow through the Foehn Valleys on Wednesday, continuing through the night, sometimes at gale force.
Once the foehn has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region, bringing heavy rainfall, gusty winds and a drop in temperature.
According to MeteoNews, Switzerland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Isles in a strong southwestern flow.
The foehn will break through the valleys on the northern sides of the Alps during Tuesday night.
The foehn will then blow through the Foehn Valleys until Thursday morning with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h; occasionally, and particularly in the canton of Uri, increasing at times to over 100 km/h.
In places the foehn may advance into the adjacent midland, and on the mountains gale force winds of over 120 km/h are even possible.
While in the north stormy foehns on Wednesday will bring summery temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture will begin to build up on the southern slopes of the Alps.
Here it will start to rain and this will continue until Thursday evening.
Over the next 48 hours the south of the Alps can expect over 100 litres of rain per square metre in places, following on from a large volume of rain which has fallen over the last few days.
On Thursday morning the foehn will die down, resulting in a cold front with heavy, sometimes thundery rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland.
In conjunction with the cold front, the wind will get stronger increasing to stormy, and temperatures will decrease sharply.
The following days will be autumnal in the north with temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees, whereas in the south it will be sunnier and warmer at the weekend with temperatures up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Some 500 years after the Reformation, Rome now has a Martin Luther Square.
In the presence of the Mayor of the City, Ignazio Marino, a hitherto unnamed square in the park on the Oppio Hill was on Wednesday bestowed with the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutreo" he is now recognised as the "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is in the centre of Rome right next to the Colosseum
The consortium of Evangelical churches in Rome proposed the choice of name.
Jens-Martin Kruse, minister of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Protestants in the Pope's city often had to hide their faith.
The square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
As a young Augustinian monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 1510 and 1511.
At the time he considered the city to be a degenerate hotbed of vice.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome.
Luther heralded the beginning of the Western Church with his theses against the selling of indulgences.
Talented artist invests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible.
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bible.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now been issued with magnificent pictures.
For Otmar Alt, who has devised his own personal interpretation of biblical stories in 150 motifs on paper and canvas, in the beginning was the picture.
The 75-year-old conceived his "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms - which are however by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: depending on the respective themes, they can appear to be thoroughly gloomy.
Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for around three years and for this project he made a subjective choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the "Book of books".
Cycles evolved, dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, the Commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
Without even approaching them, he immediately attacted multiple partners: this applies to the Luther Verlag, a publisher specialising in theological works as well as the Kettler Verlag, who focus on publishing art books.
And in particular author Klaus Altepost, who has grappled with the particular Bible passages based on the paintings.
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and "translated" them to the current day, in a topical context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's paintings.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotations of Martin Luther and each composition by the artist, who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations.
The decorated cover of the book is lettered in gold.
The 75-year-old allows at the same time a twofold insight, deep into both his soul and his emotions.
This is particularly intimate.
Ultimately, his emotions were the key trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, who was born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhut order.
"Education there took place under the shadow of the cane", remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to process this, so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again.
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age: "The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising, which is loud.
Symbolism has been driven out.
Artists have a different passion and joy in presenting things.
Pictures always have something mysterious about them; they are not decoration.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants his viewers to let themselves "fall into" the pictures, to let them leave their impression, to discover and experience the power they have: "The picture is looking for its counterpart".
At the launch of the Otmar Alt Bible on Tuesday, Klaus Altepost confessed to having "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he sees life with his pictures".
Alt was not interested in recording the whole of the Bible, selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysterious.
"This wasn't a collaboration between partners," says Altepost, "it was about the pictures; the text is merely an explanation." The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther Verlag this work is an invitation "to add depth to his life and to find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak, for Möhler, the (biblical) language of love as well as that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction draws closer for BMX track
Plans made, site found, company commissioned, mound for a circuit modelled: one year later, everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX track it was closed again.
Political and administrative failings caused anger, particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track.
So the mound was demolished and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission.
Approval will be received in October, chief local councillor Sabine Mosebach-Boch has now been able to inform the children's and young people's committee.
"I hope that this year something will be seen to happen," she said.
The work should then be started without any "further pause for thought" at the site of the former indoor swimming pool.
DFB steps up its commitment to refugees
The German football league gave clear indications at the weekend that the DFB is extending its commitment to refugees to 2019.
Football has reacted to the deteriorating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since reunification."
"Basically nobody knows, it's no concern of mine, it's not my doing."
"It is in the interests of everybody to get to grip with this issue," says DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensively at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin.
I'm going to be in the Chancellor's office next Wednesday and I'm meeting there with State Minister Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"I'm sure the topic will play a central role there," he announces.
Football can and will help.
But the politicians must set the deciding guidelines.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" to four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," declared Niersbach on the brink of the UEFA meeting in St Julian's, Malta
Several teams are also supporting the programme.
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words "We are helping – #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve of their strip instead of the usual sponsor's logo (Hermes).
"We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can," Leverkusen's sport boss Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper on Tuesday, and describes the scheme as "a matter of course".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, nobody can look away."
"We football teams can, no, we must use our charisma, our influence, and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremendously," says Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a prominent signal by the league.
The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle (Saale) for the World Cup qualifying match against Hungary.
Niersbach describes supporting the refugees as "a grand joint effort by German football."
It is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations.
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this.
The message "1:0 for a welcome," that we have sent out is being lived in football.
"That is of enormous significance," he said.
In both this year and next year the association together with the DFB team and the Federal government are making €300,000 available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015," reports Niersbach.
Reports: SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
According to several reports, the chief executive of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July.
In an accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA after midnight, he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand, reported the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, he was unconscious, then he dragged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week," the "WiWo" quoted SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott will however be able to return to work.
"We are meeting up at the board meeting in Walldorf at the beginning of October," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and "fully fit for work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen Zeitung" (Thursday's edition) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again.
"I am definitely there for SAP, completely involved in my job."
"I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, the whole time," McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott normally commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Walldorf.
Ii is important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager told the "SZ": "It could happen to anyone".
"The important thing is to get up again if you fall down."
McLaren reserve driver Magnussen out of action…
Magnussen twittered a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike.
This means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as slim as those for the Grand Prix in Japan a week later.
Football: BVB v Krasnodar without Reus: Weidenfeller in goal
All hopes have been crushed for Borussia Dortmund that Marco Reus might make a comeback in the first group match of the European league.
The international player will also be missing from the German Bundesliga leader's match in its dual with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. on Sky).
"Unfortunately he isn't in the running," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
The BVB coach is leaving it open as to whether Reus will be there on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen: "We are expecting him to return to training on Friday".
In light of the heavy burden on his professionals, Tuchel does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Reus's position.
So he has announced a change of goalkeeper.
Thus Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at absolute top level," praised the world champion's football coach.
Tuchel is leaving it open as to whether Weidenfelder will be used in all European league matches in the future.
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game.
Midfielder Julian Weigl considers team mate Reus's brisk statement that the final of the European league must be BVB's objective quite understandable: "Marco isn't so far off the mark with that".
"I think we've got a good chance of picking up the title."
Robot cars: Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars.
On Wednesday the German cabinet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) which provides, among other things, for investment in development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday, on the brink of the IAA motor show, about a "new era of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio.
There is currently a test area on the A9 motorway to try out the new technology.
In order that "no extra liability risk will be imposed" on drivers, the government wants to "examine and, where necessary, adapt" legal parameters to the new developments.
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for driverless cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention, which to date only provides for human beings as drivers.
With automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment, highly automated driving will be technically possible on motorways by 2020.
However driverless vehicles "are not anticipated until 2020" on public roads.
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will be around €8.4 billion for 2025.
"Digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," says SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers' personal data must be conclusively clarified.
And Germans still view driverless cars sceptically – much more than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation Dekra, presented to the IAA on Wednesday, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years, 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all.
In France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonomously driven cars by 2025 and in the USA 33 percent.
Anyway drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads.
Nevertheless, 15 percent could imagine this happening on motorways in free-flowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic jams.
Approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll not to play in team and doubles in European Championship
As things stand, the Dusseldorf player plans to play only in the singles in the competition, running from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision will be made on 22 September.
"It is a major loss for our team."
"The lads heard about it this morning."
"But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Timo," said national coach Jörg Rosskopf during European Championship training in Dusseldorf.
At this time Boll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with sponsors in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favourites," declared individual European champion Dimitrij Ovcharov.
But the Hamelin player, who is the top seed in Ekaterinburg, also remembers the European Championship in Schwechat in 2013.
"We didn't have Timo then either, and we still became European Champions."
"That is what we need to focus on," declared the world number five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw, of Manchester, United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg.
In the course of the tackle in the Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and after a long bout of treatment was replaced.
Initial diagnosis indicates that the 20-year-old who used to play with Bastian Schweinsteiger has broken his tibia.
Gaultier feels too old to be an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a waxworks chamber of horrors: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins which look alarmingly human thanks to video projection.
They wear the French designer's spectacular creations, which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and also put men in skirts.
"These days I can't say I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture any longer, because I have white hair."
“It used to be bleached, nowadays it's real,” says Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition, "From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk", which can be seen in the Kunsthalle at the Hypo Culture Foundation from 1 September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his own character.
Originally he was against it because, "For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you get put into a museum.
This remarkable collection has already been staged in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris.
It's about a lot more than beautiful clothes," says the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide an insight into the hard to overlook work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education.
The show is not constructed chronologically, but it is a brilliantly choreographed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort: for example a stylist has been engaged especially to look after the mannequins' hair.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the creators carted 14 tonnes of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of Oktoberfest there was also a special treat in store: a Lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are cleverer than men") and in people who are a little different, says Gaultier.
Even Gaultier's old teddy is on show in the exhibition.
He represents the designer's first, tentative steps at fashion.
As a child (he was not a good pupil and he was bad at football), he dressed his teddy in bras and dresses.
His parents did not allow him to play with dolls.
Later he taught himself fashion design.
He stole fashion magazines and scrutinised other designers' creations, Gaultier told us in Munich.
Of course, later I bought them.
He was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Decoration instead of curtains – Plauen lace as a fashion niche
There used to be long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making many metres
of embroidered fabrics and laces in vast quantities for customers who made, for example, table cloths and curtains.
This is no longer the case today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is once more important.
In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a large role, then it was replaced by the home textile industry – and now it is being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gave a few examples: lace in decoration, for accessories such as bags and for traditional costumes.
Generally, so-called vintage fashion, based on style eras from the past, is producing an increasing potential for orders.
Anyone in the textile industry in Germany who cannot serve a niche is no longer in the market.
We are already getting half of all our contracts this way.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other businesses, is a member of the Plauener Spitze und Stickereien trade association.
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label.
Sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years.
There are now hardly any private speciality shops or wholesalers.
Our products hardly reach the customers over these channels.
Nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more cheaply in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains.
Furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weakening slightly.
This is enough reason for new directions.
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness, as Cordelia Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein explains. "As of this year we have implemented a seal of quality which shows that our production is ecologically and socially compatible.
Reinhardt added, "This also applies to the materials we use".
Qualified designer Ute Schmidt teaches in the faculty for applied arts at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxony University of Zwickau and specialises in embroidery and lace.
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the designers' newest ideas and businesses, who must think primarily in commercial terms," says Schmidt.
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers.
A few years ago textile designer Kati Reuter revitalised the historic snowball lace.
The machines embroider small beads in selected places.
Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this. "In the past I had no use for traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball lace for her jewellery.
Using an elaborate process she embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with Plauen lace – young and old," says Reuter.
She also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland – primarily to customers whose forefathers lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want to have a memento.
So with my jewellery I see myself as a modern ambassador for Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
You shouldn't interfere with legends, but Disney is daring to make a new film of the classic "Mary Poppins" anyway.
But according to "Entertainment Weekly" it is not going to be a remake but a sort of sequel, set 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family in the time of the Great Depression in England.
Who is going to take the role of Mary Poppins, played 50 years ago by Julie Andrews, is not yet certain.
But the director has been decided: Rob Marshall, whose most recent film was "Into the Woods".
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predatory fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neurotoxin.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available, is heavily critical of the plans. "Risks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children," declared Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits for the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shark or swordfish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
Large predatory fish however are today so heavily contaminated with mercury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold.
Once the limit has been doubled, however, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogram.
But Foodwatch describes this as a "trick", because smaller prey fish, such as for example carp, generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today.
The reduction for small fish therefore is "a perfidious diversionary tactic which helps only the economy," declares Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumulates largely in the food chain, above all in predatory fish.
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that "even low levels, particularly in unborn children, can lead to damage to the nervous system".
The German Environment Minister, however, declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a "health risk to the general population" is not anticipated.
Mercury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal.
German coal plants, according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bundestag member Annalena Baerbock, discharge more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, is "extensively exceeded on a long-term basis," the "Spiegel" newspaper quoted from the paper in March.
In the past year, Europe-wide alerts on mercury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
Foodwatch is calling for consumers to protest against the EU plans under: www.quecksilber-aktion.foodwatch.de
28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Tip Line at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston need not always be perfect or successful.
That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an interview.
"I'm always pigeonholed, or labelled by someone who has little, if anything, to do with me and reality."
"Personally, I have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time."
"To be honest, I don't really give a damn about things like that."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she has been dubbed "Miss Perfect" in the current issue of "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the television with her hair in a relaxed bun, eating Mexican food, the magazine reports.
The question of whether she wants children makes her livid: "We women do not need to be married or have children to feel fulfilled," the Hollywood star says.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - love isn't child's play", Aniston stars as a single mother with two sons.
The film is released in Germany on 25 August.
Golfer Langer is awarded the Sport Pyramid
His experience on horseback is negligible.
At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a bit of fun.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horse decided it wanted to go home, and raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt.
After a kilometre at this speed I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," said Langer.
And with that, his riding career came to an end again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near horses.
He and his family toured the ALRV grounds, but he did not jump onto a horse for a photo.
It was Langer's first time in Aachen, and at CHIO.
He had been thoroughly convinced.
The German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event.
The friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards.
The Federal Cross of Merit, the Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon him.
Langer is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyramid.
On Saturday, he met the first person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen.
"This award means a lot to me," said Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been encouraging up-and-coming talent for years.
And in this vein, he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros on straight away.
The two-time US master's champion was inaugurated into the "Hall of Fame for German Sport" on Saturday, along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople.
Those given the award include track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Putsch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bob-sleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, judo player Frank Wieneke, show-jumper Alwin Schockemöhle, and, posthumously, handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious gathering wandered to the show-jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was underway.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals.
Comparing Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money
Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement.
But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue.
There is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's economic policies.
This is the role of the state.
If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its death, he says.
He would do things totally differently, Trump says.
He would repeal regulations, and lead a wide-reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and companies.
Conversely, Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil, giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so.
This would increase taxes for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, they have similar views on infrastructure.
There has to be investment in infrastructure, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim.
The Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War.
State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat policies, and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican party, which is critical of the state.
Consequently, Trump could lead to discussions within the party.
There are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate policies.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up.
Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty.
On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will become the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs."
"It will either be China, Germany or America - and I want it to be us."
But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well.
Neither want to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement.
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.
They should then also be better paid, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance, she says.
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.
It is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this score: Once he said that the minimum wage had to be raised, then he said it should stay the same.
But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties' tax policies.
Trump is on one side, wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics state that this will just increase the budgetary deficit.
Clinton is on the opposite side: as a minimum, she wants the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Seeking refuge: "Every refugee woman has dealt with sexual violence"
For women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
One house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Every one of them has a baby with them, the oldest of which is one year old.
One woman holds her little son in her arms.
He looks around the room inquisitively, his eyes wide.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realises she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the child.
The scene looks normal.
Until you start talking to Katrin Bahr.
She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of social assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich, in one of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone.
Condrobs opened the centre in January, in collaboration with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Help organisation.
It recently had its official opening.
60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even male visitors.
The exception is a bodyguard on the door.
"I'm not exaggerating when I say that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr.
"Men flee because of war, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families pin their hopes on them and send them to Europe," she explains.
When women flee, other reasons are in the foreground: "Many women sneak away secretly, because they see no other way out".
In their home countries, they experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That propels them forward.
And it continues even while they're on the run.
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.
And the woman are alone, unprotected by their families.
If you think that this stops as soon as they arrive in Germany, you'd be wrong, says Bahr.
Even in Germany, lone women are often seen as inferior in refugee accommodation, and, in the worst cases, they are abused.
As a result, around 90 percent of the women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, she estimates.
"Some of the children were certainly not conceived with the woman's consent".
Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything, she says.
"Or they can't bring themselves to talk about what they experienced because they are too ashamed".
Because they often don't know how to get help, there needs to be more accommodation just for them, says Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for providing accommodation for refugees.
When asked if they knew of projects like the one in Munich operating within the areas they covered, some answered with "no".
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia regions, for example, there is no similar accommodation offered by the government.
Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia, floors, or individual houses, are set aside in some shared accommodation for lone women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria: there, there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for women.
Even the European Parliament's Committee on "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" stresses that women must be provided with accommodation separate from that of the men.
In a study published on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation."
"If there is a lack of private space, or if men and women are provided with accommodation together, this can result in (perpetual) violence against women".
Washing facilities, above all, should be separate, and easily accessible for women, according to the study.
The extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich.
"Since word has got around that we exist, we have developed a long waiting list," says Bahr.
It would be easy to open a second house.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.
I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.
"We saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helm Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend with a knife in Hamburg's Harburg district, and seriously injured her.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment so he could collect his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunk attacker sliced up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came home, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old suffered injuries to her hand and body.
The police managed to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old man was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothing, he called his mother.
She then called his sister.
The 45-year-old and her partner wanted to calm down her brother.
However, she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
Consequently, she set off from home with her partner.
They met the man's ex-partner in the street.
As the two women entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to one side, and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is going to build Braunschweig's low-cost housing?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the future.
How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low-cost homes over the next few years?
At the next council meeting, the SPD is going to put forward an "action plan for homes".
But it won't be smooth sailing.
Firstly, there is the question of who is actually going to build the low-cost homes?
So far, no settlement has been reached on this point.
SPD group chairman, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on municipal land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."
The low-cost homes could also be older homes that are renovated.
However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to build on private ground?"
We want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent, but if possible, 20 percent, of homes as social housing."
A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will cost millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment, there is no agreement between groups."
The CDU wants to put as few rules on investors as possible.
The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors.
Despite that, according to Bratman, the situation in terms of the housing market is also hotting up.
If the action plan is implemented, the building authorities will be faced with additional tasks.
More staff will be needed.
It is not clear if we will get the specialist staff.
But the program is not quite complete: because the approximately 1260 new homes are to be built anyway.
But how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years?
This will come to 500 homes even by 2020.
To prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, spokeswoman for planning policy, bonds that are about to mature should be purchased by the municipality.
In addition, thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scenario.
This is possible in the west of the city.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
This is because deadlines expire at the end of the year in the west of the city.
Around 1800 homes could then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing.
The only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it.
This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step back from the target of "blending".
No longer are socially disadvantaged people to be concentrated in a small number of districts.
The Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke thinks that "the CDU will have to get into bed with us to reach a decent majority."
However, they have focused on providing more building sites for detached homes.
But that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise.
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world turns.
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.
A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.
Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.
And yes somebody might walk into a door.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.
However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly meeting some milestones.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This one is on track to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca is worried about facing Sevilla
Seville - On Sunday, FC Barcelona will fight to take their first step towards their first title of the new football season.
The Catalan team will face off against FC Sevilla in an away game in Spain's Supercup; the second leg will take place three days later in Camp Nou.
The two-time champions will have to face up to the defeated Cup finalists and reigning Europa League champions without Neymar, who is playing in the Olympic football tournament for Brazil.
In addition, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
During training the German pulled a ligament in his knee. At least it's clear who'll be wearing the number one jersey for Barca: Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter Steigen have been competing for number one status for two years now.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision either way, allowing Bravo to wear the jersey in league games, but giving it to Ter Stegen in most of their other matches.
Ahead of the first compulsory game of the new season there were doubts as to the Spanish champions' fitness: they lost 0-4 to Liverpool in a friendly game on Saturday.
Even with 3-2 in a friendly against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and co. were not really all that convincing.
On the other hand, Sevilla have to swallow their 2-3 extra-time defeat against Real Madrid in the Supercup, and are aiming for a second victory in the "Supercopa de Espana".
With eleven victories, Barcelona are the current record-holders for this competition.
Ma Long is in a league of his own, taking Gold in the table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - Ma Long, from China, is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old beat his fellow countryman and "defending champion" Zhang Jike in Rio de Janeiro 4-0 in a one-sided final (12,5,4,4).
This gave the world number one the "golden grand slam", winning the World Championship, the World Cup, the final tournament of the World Tour, and the Olympics.
The bronze medal went to Jun Mizutani from Japan.
The two Chinese men made it to the final, as expected, and fought each other for the title.
It was clear that, for the third time in a row, a Chinese athlete would take the singles title at the Olympics.
The last non-Chinese athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium was former SVS Lower Austria legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were alone at the table: they had no coaches with them between sets and during time-outs.
They had returned to the stands, leaving their charges alone to fight a fair battle against each other.
"Up until now, I have played for my country."
"In the final, I'm playing for myself," Zhang summarised.
After the game, the gold and silver medallists posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only had to fight off his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
Afterwards, he set the pace on the table, and only let Zhang score a total of 13 points.
Ma's dominance meant that the match was not as exciting as expected.
But nevertheless, there were some breathtaking volleys to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze medal match against 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonow 4-1.
The Belarussian had injured his rib in his quarter-final against German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, and was given medical treatment, and ultimately had to content himself with fourth place.
Jan-Ove Waldner from Sweden (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) also reached fourth place at the Olympics at a similarly old age for table tennis.
Donald Trump admits there are "huge problems" with his election campaign
The US Republicans' lead is plagued by significant fears that they might lose their majority, even in states that are traditionally conservative.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to the weaknesses of his election campaign in Utah, formerly a Republican stronghold.
It was a strange moment - the multi-millionaire normally puts on a pompous, self-assured performance, but this time he expressed something analogous to doubt, as correspondents report.
After he had beaten 16 rivals from within the Republican camp, doubt is now growing as to whether he will be successful in the race for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to an audience of evangelical Christians whom he asked for assistance in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He blamed false reports on his candidacy, once again giving the media a dressing-down, as he is known to do.
Republican strongholds are wavering
Utah is normally a safe seat for the Republicans.
A poll carried out by SurveyUSA in June puts Trump and his competitor on an equal footing with Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Other bodies do put Trump ahead, but not by the margin usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with broadcaster CNBC, Trump was asked how he would stop Clinton's rise, replying: "In the same way I have done before".
And he added: "Either it'll work out, or I'll go on a long, long holiday".
He said he was just "telling the truth".
If he doesn't make it because of political correctness, that's ok, Trump added.
Then, he said, I'd return to a very nice way of life.
According to press reports, the party have threatened Trump with removing financial support for his election campaign if he is unable to do any better in the polls.
Instead, the Republican congressional candidates would be offered more support.
Olympics: Brazen cheating in doping tests
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee to handle the case.
Following the second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics, trouble is looming for Kenya's track and field athletes.
After an attempt to deceive a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent one coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official announced that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic village in the name of 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
Kenya's team managers were allegedly informed of this by the doping officials.
The global IAAF federation has requested information about the matter from the IOC so it can carry out its own investigations, stated an IAAF spokesperson.
"The IAAF will perform an evaluation, depending on the findings of the investigation and the steps taken by the IOC as a result," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping check and alleged that he was Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample, and signed for it," explained Stephan Arap Soi, Kenya's Chef de Mission.
He had the athlete's accreditation as given in the list of training checks for the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich came fourth in the 800-metre race at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
Four days previously, the Head of the Kenyan track & field delegation, Michael Rotich, had been sent away from the Rio games.
He was alleged to have told sportspeople from his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport.
After numerous instances of doping, the IOC has been keeping a particularly close eye on Kenya for a while.
When the IOC announced that it would hold more than 2000 targeted doping checks in advance of the Rio games, it also announced, unusually, that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be examined particularly closely.
Ahead of the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti-doping law and a functioning system of checks.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
Following this, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.
Running is a national sport in Kenya.
The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 world championships in Beijing.
In a series of televised reports by ARD, the claim was made time and again that doping drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a mentality of cheating at sport.
IOC member Richard Pound has recently called for an investigation in Kenya to mirror that which took place into Russian athletics.
This investigation proved that doping was undertaken extensively and systematically across the sport.
As a result, Russia's track and field athletes were banned from the summer games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare anniversary year, the Salzburger Festspiele is putting on "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic couple just like Romeo and Juliet.
Featuring a surprise: Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical has gripped Salzburg: Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece, "West Side Story".
Artistic Director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music, and has made a childhood dream come true by taking on the role of Maria.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra will be conducted by Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it has a lot of Latin American influences.
There are many Latin American elements in its tempo and melodies.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect formula for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love affair with Tony with wistfulness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
Firstly because it's musically unusual!
And then there's Maria's personality.
As she says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's clever, and naive of course, and full of passion.
"She's very like me, like my Italian personality as a girl from Rome," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
We are so honoured to work with her.
She is an incredibly generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and so passionate!"
For him, conducting is a need.
You see it in all his movements, his glances - it is his life!
It is such a great chance to be able to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, fire, passion, and we both approach life with joy, which is the most important of all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, "West Side Story" is bang up-to-date: "This work is all about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we're dealing with the refugees, back then Puerto Ricans had gone to New York, and the residents of New York didn't want them there.
It's the same issues, and they were as significant then as they are today.
Fifty-nine years on, the work is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community faces mass exodus
"If you don't change your tune and praise Erdogan, your suitcase is basically packed," says the President of the Gülen-supporting Dialogue and World foundation, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection, fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, this could even grow to "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, President of the association.
The crackdown instigated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term I'm expecting ten thousand, in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to antagonise minorities and democratic opposition," said the President of the Association, Ali Toprak, to "Die Welt" newspaper on Friday.
A few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish strongholds - and as a result, 500,000 Kurds are already on the run within Turkey.
After the unsuccessful coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks have been added to the list.
Many will want to seek a new start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey.
"It is unacceptable that a country that takes in refugees is also producing them," said Toprak.
The head of the Association complained about the deliberate relocating of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and Alevi towns.
He thinks that Erdogan did this to encourage the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last big minority in Turkey: the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have already been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the Association requested that the Federal Government acted "as harshly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
A "witch-hunt" is also underway in Germany against those critical of Erdogan.
Over the past few months, I have no longer felt safe in Germany for the first time.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition.
Being singled out as a Gülen-supporter is career-destroying for teachers and other academics.
"If you don't change your tune and praise Erdogan, your suitcase is basically packed," said the President of the Gülen-supporting Dialogue and World Foundation, Ercan Karakoyun, to "Die Welt" newspaper.
As the newspaper reports, using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of political persecution.
On the reference date of June 30, this amounted to 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all people entitled to asylum (39,625).
These figures do not include people who have fled war, poverty or a lack of prospects.
Under the constitution, only individuals suffering political persecution, i.e., on the part of the state, are entitled to asylum.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Locals hear nothing about the summer elections - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood this.
In 2021 the state parliament elections will not take place at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the start of the year.
The way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another.
The locals who need to be won over by the candidates are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers in the state, in Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals - and are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
There are also practical problems to consider: during the holidays, volunteers who put up signs, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count the votes at the end, are hard to find.
Until 4 September 2016, election day and the last day of the holidays, people in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must put up with one more election without the people being consulted.
The heated phase, if that can be said at all, has already begun.
And there's something at stake: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, is fearing for his seat.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU, according to polls.
It will be exciting to see how Neuling AfD carves things up, and whether a coalition can be formed with what's left at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of the parliament since 2008, pursued a rather inconspicuous election campaign, as can be seen from his posters.
He is travelling around the region, distributing roses and chatting a bit with people, just as his legendarily taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Apart from that, Seelering has got cold feet, blaming Chancellor Merkel for the rise of the AfD.
Her refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will probably cost him his job.
The CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time.
The CDU have invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to two mass rallies; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the north-east.
But the target group wasn't right: there were more people from North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than people from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
"The majority probably came from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained to the NDR recently.
But it won't do any harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkal for once.
Apart from that, the north-east CDU is generally dispensing with the normal election events with parasols and balloons in market squares and outside shopping centres.
According to Kokert, that will only play a "minor role".
The Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region, and will have to work hard to connect with the people.
They are suffering like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present across large swathes of the region.
The advice that CDU candidate Kokert gave to his competitors is revealing: "You have got to go where it hurts, or where the people are: village fetes, Golden Wedding anniversaries, you have to make use of every birthday party."
Sellering has already called his SPD to fight a particularly committed election campaign because there is so much at stake.
According to polls, the social democrats have 22 percent, behind their partners the CDU (25), and only fractionally ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had a clear victory over the CDU (35.6 percent versus 22 percent).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the regional parliament.
They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday issue, and are waging their election war predominantly online.
"Online election campaign" is what the regional chairperson Claudia Müller has dubbed it.
Apart from that, the Greens are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, their top candidate, is currently crossing Mecklenburg's lakes on a houseboat - and is having a nice time.
Her view? "Having an election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern isn't all that bad".
B27 redevelopment: restaurants are suffering from the closure
There are hardly any problems with the speed at which the B27 is being redeveloped.
There is praise from all quarters for the people responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m.
"They have done everything so speedily," Elvira Texlaff at the Jet petrol station explains.
That is a super team.
There are also no delays.
At the start of the week, the construction site could be moved southwards in line with plans, marking the half-way point, and everything is expected to be completed by October.
The obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways.
Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation within the town has improved.
Residents can now drive on both sides of the B 27 out of Ofterdingen.
There seem to be fewer drivers taking alternative routes through the town.
"There were some serious complaints made," said Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment.
Residents in Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to put up with more traffic noise because people were looking for ways to cut through, trusting their satnav more than the signage.
This led to some lorries hurtling through residential areas.
The commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either.
"There were considerable infringements," said King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on.
Two to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute.
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, things have quietened down.
This is only a small consolation for businesses located along the B 27 that the road has reopened for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to show their hand.
But nobody we questioned hid the fact that the B 27 redevelopment had led to a drop in profits.
However, some have been affected more than others.
People who have little to do with "end customers", i.e. if they make products for other companies, have hardly been affected by the redevelopment.
Even at the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz talked of "a slight loss, at the most", but also admitted that "there had been a lack of passing trade".
Bars and restaurants along the road had been the hardest hit.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse (previously Krone), expressed himself clearly.
It has threatened our very existence.
It's not just him: all restaurants have been "hit hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil stayed away.
We have to be happy about every euro of profit we make.
He reckons that profits slumped by "far more than 50 percent".
The road redevelopment "set back" his businesses "by two years".
He had to let half of his staff go.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians would have reacted differently.
Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be financial compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment.
Göhner knows of other districts where people have acted more generously.
Despite all the complains, Göhner is convinced that his restaurant will survive.
After all, the family business moved there back in 1715, he said, referring to its long history.
He can understand that his regular customers visit less as a result of the complicated traffic system.
If you can't drive past, other places are also nice.
Göhner has no doubt that his regulars will return once the redevelopment works have been completed.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner believes that the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele mark the biggest crisis his restaurant has suffered in its long history.
Six months of construction works, that's brutal.
Law are constantly being passed in the name of anti-terrorism.
After the most recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now putting forward a host of security measures.
But what does residential status have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner have to say about it all?
Thomas de Maizière is playing the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security package.
They are not asking too much of anyone.
Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed within the parties.
I will also be involved in that.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he is responsible for results, and for reaching an "achievable agreement" within the coalition, he says.
After the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany.
However, they are more comprehensive as a result.
One thing was already known, announced, heralded: The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Neither is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise.
To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove German passports from jihadis with dual citizenship.
"They will be difficult issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician.
Despite this, he believes they are achievable, and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner.
De Maizière also presented a few new ideas.
Some of them have a lot to offer: He is planning accelerated processes for deportation and more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smartphones to be checked, and present their social media accounts for security checks.
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally tricky.
Some of it also seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered.
And for some points - such as the unequal treatment of tolerated persons - the following question is raised: What does that actually have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says, it is important to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season.
Domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent.
First the attacks in neighbouring countries: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is a large amount of uncertainty.
And yes, elections are looming.
The Union and the SPD are consequently focusing more and more on the issue of security.
Over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parties.
First a nasty argument about the Federal Police Force's equipment, then about an ideas-gathering event for security and politics-related discussions between some Ministers of the Interior in the Union, at which a burka ban and the renunciation of dual citizenship were demanded by department heads.
De Maizière is also trying to strike a conciliatory note here.
He does not think that dual citizenship will be removed.
We have dealt with the discussions in Germany.
It would not make sense to reopen discussions on this topic.
And he thinks that a burka ban would come up against constitutional issues.
However, it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout, and whether it really is "achievable" for his coalition partner.
There are few things inside it that could cause problems.
But the SPD is also currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself.
SPD Head Sigmar Gabriel showed that the party was happy to discuss the issue, albeit sensitively at first, saying that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further."
Volkswagen gets off lightly.
Despite the diesel scandal, global delivery figures are increasing.
But things aren't quite as rosy in all markets.
The recall has led to fuss about one term.
Volkswagen's deliveries were more restrained in the second half of the year.
Thanks to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal.
However, in July, the VW core brand suffered, particularly in Western Europe, thereby affecting overall sales, as the Dax-listed company announced.
Globally, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month the year before.
In its home market of Germany, deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth.
Head of brand sales, Jürge Stackmann, blamed July's poor figures on the loss of two sales days in Europe.
In addition, some key markets saw "changed economic climates", which led to fewer purchases.
In addition to the situation regarding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU had also had an impact, a spokeswoman said.
In the USA, where the emissions scandal first began, the books are once again in the red.
The Chinese market is a source of great support for VW.
In total, Lower Saxony's own brand, which was most affected, has got off lightly from the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, there is a minus in the books for deliveries amounting to 0.9 percent of 3.37 million vehicles.
Head of sales at the company, Fred Kappler, was once again able to bring out an increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period, coming to a global total of 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests.
In Germany alone, VW has called 2.5 million vehicles back to workshops to be refitted.
In the course of modifying the vehicles VW emphasised that refitting them would have no negative effects.
After the vehicles have been modified, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse.
After modification, the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "as good as a guarantee" but would not talk of an actual "guarantee", as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles.
Legal intricacies are the reason for this.
"Focus" reported that Volkswagen would provide its German customers with a guarantee for modified diesel cars nonetheless.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on the Monday previous.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW must fully meet the requirements of my investigative committee and the KBA."
"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, according to the Ministry.
VW took on the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse as a result of the modification, and all vehicle values relevant to type approval would remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as has been mentioned in corporate circles.
Volkswagen believes that the broad term "guarantee" could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the new software, even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it.
It is also in the customers' interest to prevent confusion with guarantee clauses for any other faults that have nothing at all to do with the emissions scandal.
This is why VW will not be using the term "guarantee".
The Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so.
Managing Director of the bank, Josef Paul, said on Thursday that "this only applies to 139 customers with 40 million euros in their current accounts or day-to-day accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks believes this is an isolated case, and does not see it as a sign: normal savers "need not worry about being hit with penalty interest on the pennies they've put aside".
If banks invest money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay penalty interest of 0.4 percent.
From September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
For some time, he has been managing 40 million euros that could be withdrawn any day, and that he is unable to make use of.
"The money has been sitting in my account at the Central Bank, and costing 0.4 percent," the bank CEO said.
"I cannot put 4000 euros aside for every million."
He is passing on the costs under the "polluter pays" principle.
It would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raffeisen Bank's safe: "I have already been through four raids, I don't want a fifth!" the bank's managing director said.
Most customers have been understanding, and have switched to other forms of investment.
Only a small number moved to other banks.
The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring significant costs".
It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a permanent basis, from a business perspective".
As a result, some German banks have increased the fees they charge for account management, credit cards or transfers.
Thuringia's "Volks- und Raffeisen Bank" in Altenburger Land hit the headlines in 2014 when their Skatbank branch imposed penalty interest on investments of more than three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, managing director of the banking association, said: "We are not expecting that private customers will all have to pay fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that".
A banker said that, in Tegernsee, there was "clientele who were rather better off in terms of assets."
"That can be a problem for a small bank," if the bank is looking after their money for free.
The Cooperative Bank of Gmund was founded in 1911, and has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Famous actors, sportspeople and enterpreneurs live in the region.
Spokesperson Ernst said that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses".
The President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that "the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very, very high".
Competition is fierce, and there is the risk that investors will move to competitors.
Customers in Germany will not put up with that, broadly speaking.
Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54, apparently.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.
It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.
"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.
That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More of the product side, less of the music.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.
Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.
She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.
She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.
Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is pure "art vinyl."
But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying the sharks, says record goes to a female thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres in length
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin keeps his fighting spirit
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, cycling professional Tony Martin will keep his chin up.
"I'm going to keep the World Championship in my sights, stay optimistic, and keep fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Facebook on Thursday ahead of his journey home from Rio.
He was unable to provide an explanation for his poor finish in 12th place on Sugar Loaf Mountain.
"It's honestly hard for me to comment on my time from yesterday," said Martin.
He said he needed to reflect and analyse the reasons behind the debacle.
Martin had wanted to compete for the title at the time trial World Championship in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to take a real look at everything we've changed recently."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial World Champion, who had lost to Olympic gold medallist Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) by more than three minutes over the course of the 54.5km race on Wednesday.
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses out on the semi-final
Laura Siegemund's reign of success comes to an end in the Rio quarter-final: Ranked 32 in the world, the player from Metzingen will definitely miss out on the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament after losing 1:6, 1:6 against Monic Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34).
Sigemund, who has been struggling with back problems, was only able to hold her serve once, and seemed powerless in comparison to earlier rounds.
On Thursday, potential medallist Angelique Kerber (Kiel/no. 2) had the chance of making the semi-final.
The winner of the Australian Open faced off against Brit Johanna Konta (no. 10).
The last German tennis player to win was Tommy Haas, who took the silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
The last time there were two German tennis players in the quarter-finals of the summer games was in 1992.
There has never been a German-German Olympic semi-final.
Company gets involved in start-up for live video game streaming
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - and Microsoft wants to profit from this too.
The technology company has purchased start-up Beam, which has specialised in this hobby.
On Thursday Microsoft did not announce how much many had been spent on the takeover.
Beam launched its programme in January, and already has more than 100,000 users.
They can watch other people play, and also get involved themselves.
For example, they can give players missions to complete and confront enemies, and provide equipment.
Games giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
Facebook is to help on the path to making them global media events.
The advertising industry has already pricked up its ears.
The start-up's employees, who were previously based in Seattle in the US state of Washington, will now move to Microsoft's headquarters in California's Redmond, Beam's co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi reported.
The takeover will not change anything for customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video games department that is linked to the Xbox console.
The market for live-streaming video games is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms include Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
In 2014 Twitch was purchased by online retailer Amazon - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's speeders will have to get used to the new generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new speed cameras are being trialled, which are supposed to be particularly effective at catching those who drive too fast.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailer made by Vitronic, a company form Wiesbaden, could be used at accident blackspots, for example, where it is too dangerous for the police to go.
For example, roadworks on a motorway, or a bridge that is due to be repaired, and therefore has a temporary speed limit often lack the infrastructure to support a fixed speed camera to ensure that speed limits are being adhered to.
It can also be too dangerous or expensive to keep assembling and unassembling the speed camera at these points.
The enforcement trailer is autonomous: its battery lasts for five days of continuous measurement, and data is transferred in encrypted form via a modem.
Thanks to laser measuring technology, all vehicles across several lanes can be tracked at the same time.
Variable speed limits and driving bans based on time, lane or vehicle type can also be monitored.
When powered up, the manufacturer says that any car with a trailer coupling can move the trailer.
To prevent it from simply being stolen, it sinks down when measuring, making its wheels disappear into the armoured, bullet-proof exterior.
In addition, the speed camera's in-built alarm system is designed to protect it from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used in them.
Foreign authorities are also using the new technology for speed cameras: recently France ordered 100 of them, after ordering 150 the year before.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.
Setting a clear example for 31 years
The Managing Director of the "Veitensteingruppe" Water Supply Association, Rupert Göller, is retiring.
The Assocation "sets an example for the entirety of Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water supply association as a role-model for the large water producers.
That was how the association was described in a segment on Bavarian radio.
A little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the Association.
The Veitensteingruppe's work was described as "setting an example for the entirety of Bavaria".
Rupert Göller is behind it all: he worked as an employee of the Association for 31 years, and has been its Managing Director for 28.
He has now gone into retirement at the age of 65.
The Veitensteingruppe Drinking Water Supply Association has its headquarters in Kottendorf in the commune of Breitbrunn, and provides 150,000 cubic metres of water annually, supplying 32 villages and hamlets with around 5,500 inhabitants.
The communes of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the municipality of Baunach are also members.
Water supply contracts are in place for additional municipalities and communes.
Current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayoress Gertrud Bühl (FW), looks back to when Ruper Göller was brought on as a water officer in 1985, and was promoted to Managing Director of the Association as soon as 1988.
"His tasks were very varied, ranging from constructing water pipes and performing maintenance work through to office and organisational tasks, budget planning, calculating fees and contributions, through to getting involved in emergencies at weekends," the chairman said.
She pointed out some exceptional successes, including commissioning and opening the new spring (1994), purchasing land near the new spring (1998), compensating farmers, renovating the elevated tanks (1999), creating a new computer management system (2004), and renewing some of the water pipes.
Things never stopped, and renovations were always underway: water means life, and drinking water is the most important foodstuff of all.
In her laudatory speech, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable, and upstanding service over 31 years.
He put his heart and soul into the Water Supply Association, and lived for it as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago he gave a presentation at the Water Forum for the District of Lower Franconia as a true practitioner of the Veitensteingruppe's successful nitrate reduction concept.
He received considerable appreciation and praise for this.
For his part, Rupert Göller praised water officer Alfons Griebel, who had worked alongside him for 28 years.
He is the best water officer, and he was a loyal lad.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
From his perspective, the high point was the construction of the spring and the restructuring of the Association.
However, the largest challenge and most difficult shift was when the pipe broke on the Kirchlauter elevated tank on 3 January one year.
We had to work through the night at minus 17 degrees to ensure the locality would be supplied with water.
Even the supply from the new spring was sometimes only maintained because the elevated tank at Pettstadt was filled by hosepipe.
The management of the Drinking Water Supply Association was passed to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will be Rupert Göller's successor.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other parents affected by the disease: "You must be brave enough to talk about it."
"Medicine has come a long way," the 44-year-old said to Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she would die.
Tiago is now eight years old and has made great strides, being schooled privately in New York, where the best therapists are located.
"To give an example: If I ask him what happened two years ago when I sang at Milan's La Scala, he can't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago is the offspring of Netrebko's liaison with bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Crime passionelle in Bargteheide - man shoots his partner
A 35-year-old man shot and fatally wounded his partner on Friday around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargeteheide (in the district of Stormarn).
"The man himself called up and admitted to having shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, she said, and he is officially being sought.
This search is now happening across Germany, because Sven S. might be travelling by car.
The man is around 1.8 m tall, muscular, sun-tanned, and has a bald patch.
The police have now issued a photo of him.
But it is a couple of years old.
The man now has a bald patch.
The man should not be approached.
The police believe he may still be carrying a weapon.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police are talking of a "crime passionelle".
The victim was apparently born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police force in Lübeck dealing with the crime initially did not want to disclose any information on the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It is a homicide."
"We are not saying any more at this time," a police spokeswoman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a SWAT team was at the scene.
Steel - There's a ray of hope for the German steel industry
The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared additional costs that could have run into the millions.
The sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy, but these are now off the table.
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry.
"I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations."
The European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.
According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year.
Gabriel told WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission, following discussions with Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition.
The EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steelworks are replaced.
This too will not be levied against the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement Germany had reached with the EU Commission on electricity self-generation.
The agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised.
Gabriel's positive efforts are particularly important for the steel industry.
"It is the first step within our "steel is the future" campaign."
"This needs to be followed by other steps."
"Climate targets and employment objectives also need to be taken into account during negotiations to reform emissions allowances," explained IG Metall's CEO, Jörg Hofmann, in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, Europe's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing.
The situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dumping.
The situation improved slightly during spring of this year.
On the one hand, import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel, on the other, economic prospects in China brightened up.
It is not clear how long prices will remain perked up for.
The German sector leader, Thyssenkrupp, was cautious on Thursday.
Prices had plateaued recently, he said.
The sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further.
Thyssenkrupp also did not want to rule out closing individual plants.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in Germany's steel industry.
Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday.
After a brief spike in May, the amounts produced shrunk for a second consecutive month.
Since the start of the year, production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year.
The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months thanks to an improved situation in terms of orders.
Community, mind, health: singing is good for the elderly
Singing has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, happy, and generally more alive, she says.
And additionally, she's doing something good for her health and her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons, says Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly.
Most elderly people sing in a choir and share the enjoyment they get from music with like-minded people, says Hackler.
By regularly spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts.
Social and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also experienced this in her choir: "Arranging and organising things with people, being able to rely on others and learn from them - a choir is a really unique way of being together with other people".
Singing can be demanding in the positive sense, Hackler thinks.
This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a controlled manner.
If you push your lungs to their limits regularly, you will not run out of breath as quickly in day-to-day life.
And if you are interested in keeping the sound of your voice as you age, too, singing is the perfect hobby.
Singing often has a really special effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations.
For older generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in older people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth.
Song texts, and melodies in particular, can even be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past.
Singing also demands particular mental exertion, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge.
In particular, older people who live alone can practice how to focus on people other than themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in a choir, Hackler thinks.
A happy audience is great praise.
Even one's self-esteem is boosted by singing in a choir.
Being able to show yourself that by practising for a long time, you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength.
So there are enough good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - even if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests.
You're not singing by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there?
The elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler.
If someone you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them.
In addition, many towns offer an overview of the choirs in their region.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can approach the parish or churchwarden directly.
Many choirs for the elderly can also be found online.
If you don't have access to the internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours to help you look things up online.
If you're interested in singing, you should absolutely join a choir, Hackler thinks.
Singing is good for the soul and is a kind of release - no matter how old you are.
Female cats react more sensitively than male cats to the mewls of their kittens
Biologists in Hanover have researched the effect kittens' cries have on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected - but, compared to their female counterparts, they always acted the same way.
Female cats can tell how agitated kittens are by their miaowing.
They react ten percent quicker to kittens who sound to be in great distress, the scientists from the Veterinary University and Medical University of Hanover discovered.
Male cats do respond to kittens' cries - but always to the same extent.
"It is clear that the acoustic differences between the miaows of kittens that are more or less agitaged are either imperceptible or unimportant for male cats," the biologists Wiebke Konerding, from MHH, said.
She is the first author of the study published in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" specialist journal this Friday.
In a previous experiment the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of a kitten's miaow changes depending on how urgently they need help.
Nine adult male cats and eight female cats from the MHH's animal husbandry programme were examined.
Firstly, they were played the sound of a kitten who had been taken from the birthing box and separated from its mother and siblings for three minutes.
Then they were played the sound of a more agitated cat, which had also been lifted up.
Despite the low sample size, the researchers believe the results to be significant.
"All females, even those who did not have their offspring, were able to differentiate between miaows," said Konerding.
They turned towards the speaker quicker if it was playing the sound of a highly agitated kitten.
This ability may be innate, or may develop as the animal reaches sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the male cats reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have researched women's and men's reactions to babies' cries on multiple occasions.
Even in this field a few studies showed that woman reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they had their own children or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski and "Gala" are shooting for the Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.
An important football match is taking place in Turkey for the first time following the attempted coup.
Ahead of the duel between arch-rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual".
Even when announcing the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July, the government emphasised that this would not affect citizens' daily life.
This does not apply to those people suspected of being followers of the imam Fethulla Gülen, who is believed to be responsible for the attempted coup.
And this doesn't stop for football.
The state prosecutor has issued a warrant for the arrest of former star striker Hakan Sükür.
Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.
Sükür is accused of being a follower of the imam Fethullah Gülen, whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds responsible for the attempted coup.
While the state of emergency, declared for ninety days, will continue until October, it is having practically no effect on the lives of most Turks.
On Wednesday, Erdogan announced that the night-time "democracy vigils" in public places across the country have come to an end.
The sport - like the entire country - is divided into those who support Erdogan, and those who do not.
Fans of the workers' club Besiktas, in particular, are not traditionally counted among the President's friends.
However, the strict rejection of military coups is what brings most Turks together, in the light of dramatic historical events.
And even the fans can agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
For cup winners Gala, it will once again depend on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne native has proved his sporting value over the last season: with 17 goals and nine assists across all competitions, the 31-year-old closed his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the goal that led to a 1-0 victory.
The "Fanatik" newspaper praised him, saying "he was the best player on the pitch."
He finished the season in style, and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record-holders came to a happy end.
After their knockout in the heats for the Champions League, the "Lions" also left the Europa League early on.
They only reached sixth place in the Süper Lig.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only chance to win something.
"We did it - and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
Winners Besiktas saw a better year of play.
This is mainly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the groundwork for their fourteenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Süper Lig's star goalkeeper.
This is also why fans are hoping that the 31-year-old returns.
Gomez, under contract at AC Florenz and only on loan to Besktas, announced after the attempted coup that he would not return to the country after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation.
"But if Mario wants to come here, all he has to do is say," "Kicker" specialist magazine quoted club chairman Fikret Orman as saying.
However, the star would have to be prepared to give up around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, as Orman made clear: "We cannot pay the salary that Florenz do".
Despite doping: These athletes are still in with a chance of winning medals in Rio
Justin Gatlin, aged 34, has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is banned from taking her place on the start line.
Other track athletes who have been found guilty can only laugh - they are in Rio competing for medals.
The issue of doping continues to hit the headlines during the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who appealed against her doping conviction shortly before the games to enable herself to compete, was booed and shouted at as she started her 100-metre breaststroke race.
It was a bizarre scene: She waltzed into the pool with a smile plastered on her face, a deliberately provocative entrance.
As it became clear that she would not take the gold medal, the audience cheered enthusiastically.
But there are many other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial track athletes.
He has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and from 2006 to 2010).
Since being banned, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion is running faster than ever before: covering 100m in 9.80 seconds, he is the world number one, and is Usain Bolt's major challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion was handed a six-month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken Oxycodone.
The 29-year-old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad toothache after an operation.
Sandra Perkovic (discus/Croatia): in 2011, the 2012 Olympic Chamption, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methyhexaminine.
Perkovic said that she had not knowingly taken the drug, and was banned for six months.
This year's four longest throws were by the woman tipped for gold.
LaShawn Merrit (200, 400 4x400m relay/USA): Champion at the Beijing Olympics and two-time 400m World Champion, Merrit tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
Merritt claimed that a penis enlargement drug was to blame.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world in the 200m and the 400m.
Ivan Tichon (hammer, Belarus): There is hardly another athlete who has been retrospectively stripped of so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after he was proved to have been involved in testosterone doping.
Now 40 years old, he was also stripped of his 2004 Olympic silver medal for doping with steroids, and his 2006 European Champion title for testosterone misuse.
His bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics was also taken away, but it was returned to him following a decision by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS.
With 80.04m he is at second place in the global rankings.
Liu Hong (20km walking, China): The world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May, but will still be on the start line in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supplement, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s ban was lenient, and ended as early as July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Thomas Schnöll, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said early on Friday morning.
She has some cuts, he says, and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave hospital.
She plans to return home at the start of September.
It is currently unclear whether other Austrian citizens have been affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket or in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumpon.
According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities as a result.
Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital city, Bangkok, two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to police reports, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three people from Holland and three Italians.
There were another two explosions early on Friday morning, with another person killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the morning.
Police reports state that a taxi driver was injured in the explosion, which occurred near Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers.
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's south-east coast, which led to the death of a civil servant.
According to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory.
Finally, explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several casualties.
There is apparently a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bomb attacks bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early on Friday morning.
"We are assuming that the attacks were coordinated".
It is too early to speculate on possible motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country.
However, the Thai police issued a statement that the attacks were not connected with the Islamist resistance movement or with global terrorism.
"It is just local sabotage, limited to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.
It is more reasonable to assume that the bombs were set off by opponents of the military junta currently ruling the country.
Over the past few days, the authorities have received notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for.
It is still apparently unclear who is behind the attacks.
The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security around important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts.
Small-scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thailand, but they are rarely directed at tourists.
There is a palace in Hua Hin that was used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation on its homepage that Austrians follow the instructions from the Thai security agencies at all times.
The provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, along with Preah Vihear and its surroundings, have been issued with a high security alert (security level 3).
After skirmishes between security forces and Muslim sectors of the population, people are advised against all but essential travel to these districts.
The rest of the country is on an increased security alert (security level 2).
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This will give the military large-scale influence even in the years to come.
The Head of the junta, and Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos when the country was heading towards stability, an improved economic climate and tourism.
The military junta took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, and believes that it has led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to quell the latent resistance brewing with Muslim rebels in the southern edges of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict so far.
A little under a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bankok - the majority of whom were foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack in the country's recent history.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has the right-wing "Identitäre Bewegung" movement in its sights.
After several regional authorities had done so, the body charged with protecting the constitution across Germany has also put the group on a watchlist.
"In terms of the "Identitäre Bewegung" movement, we can see clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin.
Muslim migrants or migrants from the Middle East were vilified in an extremist manner.
That is why we will also be monitoring the movement from henceforth.
The "Identitäre Bewegung" is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It fights against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of national identity through foreigners".
Bodies protecting the constitution across nine federal states - Bremen, Bavarian, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already have the "Identitäre" under observation.
Maaßen said that his authority had worked closely with regional authorities to come to its decision.
"Groups such as the "Identitäre Bewegung" are trying to approach their target group on their level," said the head of constitutional protection.
In general, extremists attempt to speak to them in young people's own language, often with pop music.
Radical Islamists and right-wing extremists both do this.
It's not calm advertisement for the actual matter at hand.
This propaganda is designed to provoke an emotional response in people.
Young people are particularly vulnerable to this.
This is dangerous.
Recently, there have been reports from several federal states pointing out contact between members of the "Identitäre" movement and AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no information on this.
In terms of constitutional protection, potential contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point, he says.
It depends on whether the party in question - in this case, the AfD - changes its focus and becomes extremist as a result of particular people who are extremists.
Therefore, the decisive factor is whether these people exert a controlling influence over the party.
This has not been noted.
With regard to the clear increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of a new right-wing terrorism.
But, over the past few years, we have determined that right-wing terrorist structures can exist.
There was the "Old School Society" group or the "Freitaler Group".
It can absolutely be the case that additional right-wing terrorist groups or small gatherings come to exist, and plan attacks on asylum seekers, refugee shelters, or for other far-right motives.
However, there is no Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of far-right terrorism that we can discern.
The groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had previously not been involved in the far-right scene.
That is frightening.
Many of those suspected of carrying out the attacks on asylum centers were not viewed as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or members of the far-right scene.
"This means that many people have committed crimes who previously paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet sensation
Olympic athletes or world records aren't always the only things to hit the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by Robel Kiros Habte's brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to see him in the televised images.
He just disappeared - no matter how wide a perspective was used.
Habte finally become a viral internet sensation on social networks.
The 24-year-old completed his heat 48 seconds slower than the next-fastest competitor, taking place 59 out of 59.
However, it was his not-quite sporty figure that caught the eye of the international media.
Why was the 24-year-old taking part in the Olympic games?
The Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming federation.
This is given out to popularise swimming in underrepresented countries.
Because most athletes from Ethiopia run, Habte wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte prepared himself for the big race.
The first nicknames were soon doing the rounds.
Some media outlets dubbed him "Robel the whale".
With reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod".
His time, almost one minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle, played no part in this.
Comparisons were also made with "Eric the Eel".
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race also drew media attention.
The performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable: he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own.
Moussambani was then greeted by wild cheering.
He was 22 years old at the time, and had learnt to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began.

Geretsried - Theft from the owner of a shop on the Neuen Platz.
According to the police, the 67-year-old woman from Geretsried left her shop around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, and forgot to close a ground-floor window.
When she returned the next morning at around 8.15 a.m. around 250 euros was missing from the till.
There was no trace of the perpetrator.
The shop did not have CCTV.
Trump is not taking the threat of election defeat too seriously
The Republican candidate for the presidency, Donald Trump, spoke out at an election event in Florida.
If things don't work out with the presidential election, Donald Trump already has a plan B in place.
He would go on holiday.
Donald Trump wouldn't really mind if he lost the US presidential election in November: "Either it'll work out, or I'll go on a long, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in an telephone interview with US television channel CNBC.
If he doesn't make it because of political correctness, that's ok, Trump said.
For example, he called US President Barack Obama, and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, the founders of terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, resistance continues to grow.
The postal service gets on board with electric vehicles
Detusche Post's electric truck in action.
Other companies are clearly interested in the vehicle.
The postal service is also planning to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
Soon the company will start retailing the vehicle.
The postal service wants to bring its electric vehicle to the free automotive market from next year.
"We want to start selling it to third parties," a postal service spokesman said on Friday.
For months the company has been examining whether the StreetScooter it developed, which is used to deliver letters and parcels, could be sold to other sectors as well.
Managing Director of the postal service Jürgen Gerdes said that there was always demand from tradesmen.
According to information in "Der Spiegel", a news magazine, the Bonn-based company will soon start mass production of the vehicle.
The company is planning to use its own factories to build up to 10,000 vehicles per year, per level.
Gerdes announced that the company wanted to increase the size of its fleet of electric cars considerably, and that its long-term aim was to switch over completely to these environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very strong step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will switch over the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been out and about on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK managing director steps down after disappointing figures
Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hartmann.
His resignation came swiftly - but it was not a complete surprise.
The tricky situation in which market research firm GfK finds itself made it self-evident that Managing Director Matthias Harmann's seat became more and more unstable the longer the success he promised failed to materialise.
Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg's market research firm GfK: After another round of disappointing figures and the resignation of the managing director, the firm, fifth in its sector globally, is on the brink of a personal new start.
GfK's managing director wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The managing director of GfK's supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, has already announced that he will be leaving the supervisory committee with effect from 12 September.
The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, who is currently a member of the board of directors, will take over the management of the board on 1 September.
Officially, he will take on the role of "board spokesman" until Hartmann's successor has been found.
The company cited "different viewpoints" on long-term business direction as the reason behind the resignation.
A company spokesman did not give further details on Friday.
It is currently not clear who will head up the market research firm in the future.
In investment circles, on Friday it was said that shareholders were greatly disappointed by the lack of success following the restructuring programme implemented years ago.
Mr Hartman has headed up GfK since 2011.
"The benefits of the restructuring programme will only become visible after 5 years," he said.
As a result of GfK's recent poor figures, every shareholder would be a little unsettled, he said.
"If that were the case at BMW, the quants would be too," he said.
After suffering losses in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop losing money in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 lower than it had been in the same quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first six months of the year, turnover (721.2 million euros) had shrunk by 3.4 percent.
The company's reduced value because of the difficult economic climate had impacted second-quarter profits, in particular.
The goodwill amortisation of 139 million euros required for the consumer experience sector was provided by the company, leading to a final loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had made a profit of 19.7 million.
Incident - Bus slips into a ditch in Krummhörn: eight people injured
On Thursday, an accident involving a coach carrying 43 elderly people in Krummhörn (district of Aurich) led to eight people being injured.
Two of the passengers suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old bus driver, employed by a coach company based in Eisenach, said that she had to swerve to avoid an oncoming lorry that was partly on the wrong side of the road.
The bus came off the right-hand side of the road, and skidded into a ditch, a spokeswoman for the police force of Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"As a result of the way the bus was positioned, people were not able to leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the passengers.
Six rescue vehicles and an ambulance were in attendance at the scene of the accident on the no.2 road.
Uninjured passengers were transported back to Krummhörn's Pewsum district by regular bus.
They waited there until a replacement bus was sent by the coach company.
Investigators are asking the lorry driver and any witnesses to make themselves known to the police.
From 1 October 2016, fees per cubic metre of sewage for the area covered by the sewage plant at Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros as previously, 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp, and 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros) for Azendorf.
The sewage fee for the sewage works in Azendorf will be raised again if it is necessary to carry out improvement works.
According to an estimated calculation, sewage fees in Azendorf will then come to 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the district administration of Kulmbach approved the budget, it was determined that these sewage plants were underfunded.
The market town of Kasendorf is legally obliged to run the sewage works so that they break even.
From 1 October 2016, individuals and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig a little deeper.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the sewage plants serving the market town.
Between October 2016 and September 2020, overfunding and underfunding from the previous calculation period will be balanced out.
Schmidt justifies the major fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small and deal with a very small amount of waste, namely between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a pear.
As a result of the low distribution, expenses for critical repairs amounting to several thousand euros, for example, seem major.
In addition, the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decreasing.
Furthermore, the previous calculation period did not include renovation and repair works to a great extent for all three treatment plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants in Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the waste treatment plant at Azendorf needed to have its mechanical ventilation system replaced because of damage.
The conveyor system in the pumping station at Welschenkahl is almost 20 years old, and needs to be completely overhauled; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lopp has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dredged, its sewage sludge removed, and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were also coupled with perpetual support and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same is true for electricity costs: in the previous calculations for 2011/2012, they are far below their current levels.
Steinhäuser pointed out that, even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plants, the expenses for running and maintaining them "were significantly impacted".
As a result, Schmidt expanded, the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years.
From Steinhäuser's perspective, the plants mentioned will remain in a precarious situation in the long run, especially as the area covered by Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are running at a deficit.
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.
They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.
This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.
From this, trampoline offers a respite.
The trampoliner's vector is up.
Forward motion is not the goal.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
It is not without competition, of course, nor without difficulty, but for the duration of a routine, there is no frantic charge toward the end, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
But that may be changing.
"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.
Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that is changing as well.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.
After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
Instead of toning things down for a general election audience, Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.
The coffee is still good, too.
Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.
It even reused the lights from the old Verb.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
There are brown-rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"A lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other perks.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I've needed to smell that," he said.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the Syrian people.
He risked everything to save other people's lives.
Now the 30-year-old has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group which, according to Bild newspaper, had saved the lives of 60,000 people.
2,900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people from bombed-out houses and perform first-aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protection volunteer showing him during an 11-hour operation to rescue an infant from the ruins of a house went viral in 2014.
It made the Syrian a glowing figurehead amidst the horror of the war.
However, he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad."
"If I were to die saving lives, I would think that God saw me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself became a victim of an attack, he had spoken in a video about the recent bomb attacks on Syria.
Helicopters had released four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children were killed, and seven people have been left with breathing difficulties.
"We are now clearing away the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," quoted Bild as his last words before he died.
The fatal bomb dropped by the Assad regime was supposed to have been aimed at terrorists.
The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks generally only come to the surface in winter.
After being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.
It was born in 1624 and has swum through the North Atlantic at 1km/h right through to the present day.
Greenland sharks only give birth to young at the age of 150.
Greenland sharks swim leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.
The five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow pace of life seems to be the key to a long life.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues wrote an article in "Science", the specialist journal, about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"It's crazy," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock about this lifespan - which is a world record for a vertebrate.
It is true that evolutionary biologists had long thought that Greenland sharks had been around for a very long time.
They were simply lacking the proof.
It is hard to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius.
As a result, researchers know little about how Greenland sharks live.
Their slow speed was measured by researchers off Svalbard, who fitted six animals with a tracker.
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.
It may be the case that they hunt down sleeping animals, or patrol on the ocean floor and look out for corpses that have sunk downwards from higher levels of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks caught in the depths of the North Atlantic by fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off the coast of Greenland or Svalbard.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.
They use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.
This core of the eye's lens comes into being even before the shark is born, and the proteins in it are not renewed subsequently.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores.
Consequently, they were likely born after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments released large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, contained less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 monitor gave a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark an age of 335, while the record-holding shark, at 502 centimetres, was apparently 392 years old.
It was already known that female Greenland sharks first had offspring when they were more than four metres long.
Now researchers have been able to map this length onto an age.
As one of the animals, 392 centimetres long, was likely on the threshold of sexual maturity, and had an age of 156, it seems that Greenland sharks take at least 150 years to be able to reproduce.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
It is not by chance that such Methuselahs predominantly live in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.
As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible.
This means they mature later - and age slower.
The animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.
This is because their volume increases much quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat.
This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is much bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant.
Another advantage is that they have fewer enemies.
"This means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.
By contrast, a very large animal can invest its resources in having a longer life.
Construction sites coming as a twinpack
The commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session.
The committee was pleased to hear mayor Robert Putz' announcement that "we can finally begin to market the residential construction sites that have recently been marked out".
After plot, parcelling and accessibility questions had been answered, and applications for measurements had been made, there was nothing standing in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (near Binderstraße - development section 1) to interested parties.
The communal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural, peaceful residential commune of Schönau will attract young families and older people alike.
As said, people prepared to build on these sites should apply in the town hall from now, and the communal council will probably discuss giving out the plots in its September meeting.
So that it would be able to answer questions on the movement of additional businesses, in connection with the creation of jobs, the communal council decided to amend the space usage plan first re-drawn in spring of this year.
Consequently, the business area already marked out in Unterzeitlarn will be expanded to include a further two plots near state road 2112.
Frankfurt will benefit from Brexit
The city on the river Main will soon have the best chance against the competition of Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London.
"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," said Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area.
After the Brexit referendum it is unclear whether financial institutions will still be allowed to run European financial business from London.
Registration in the UK is all that has been required to date for the "EU passport".
This is generally used by large US banks.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group expects to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years.
According to the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board.
While Paris has the headquarters of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can communicate directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large funds industry, like Dublin, its infrastructure lets it down.
Thanks to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to.
In addition, the city's easily available business properties are a win.
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," said Voigtländer.
Rents for top-class business properties are 50% higher on the banks of the Seine than on the banks of the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt can offer better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels.
In a table compiled by management consultants Mercer, the city was ranked 7th, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37 th.
And even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "Thanks to its already strong position as a financial hub for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could be able to attract additional banks and investors," IW concluded.
Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers.
This is also to do with strength ratios: According to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Municipal council reaches unanimous decision: No new kiosk to be built on the St. Goarer bank of the Rhine
Normally the people of St. Goarer are happy to accept investment from businesses - but retail in the core of the city is clearly capable of developing itself.
The municipal has now unanimously rejected the application to build a new retail kiosk on the bank of the river Rhine close to the Rhine balcony currently under construction.
"We are generally happy to welcome new businesses, but this kiosk does not fit in this exposed position on the bank of the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath on behalf of the CDU faction.
Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: drinks cash-and-carry in Waldbröl raided
A robbery took place on Thursday evening in the drinks cash-and-carry of Rewe XXL on Walbröl's Gerberstraße.
Three people dressed in dark clothing and with their faces covered brandished a gun and demanded that staff at the cash-and-carry hand over cash. They made a run for it on foot, and then probably got into a silver VW Golf.
The police did not report how much money had been stolen.
Between 1.6 and 1.7 m tall, the perpetrators were relatively short.
The drinks cash-and-carry can be accessed directly from the Rewe supermarket's car park, and is tricky to observe.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße along Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and then fled, possibly towards the B 256 (Schladern ring road) in the silver car from the Schotterparkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi-storey car park.
Anyone who saw anything around the time of the crime (around 7.45 p.m.) that is connected with the robbery should contact the police immediately.
Nagold: Fun and games at the summer fete
Children and young people from the youth work day group/social group work project from the child protection league of Nagold spent eight gloriously happy days with their social workers during the summer camp in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The lively group spent the first week of the school holidays in the peacefully-located Hartwäldle holiday camp.
There were several day trips on the agenda.
One trip saw the group head to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.
Another saw them visit Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour around the world-famous cloisters.
The third trip took the group to Pforzheim.
The group learnt lots about how the Celts lived and what they ate in the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf.
On warm dates, the group cooled off at the Tiefensee lake in Maulbronn: perfect for jumping into, swimming around in, and paddling.
Children and carers cooked their own favourite meals, such as mini German spätzle dumplings in a sour sauce, traditional Seebronner Pfännle and Iselshauser Bloff, English breakfast, and Tübingen-style bolognese.
During workshops, children could practise baktik, make beautiful jewellery with pearls and stones, or create a Roman windmill game from wood.
Other highlights of the summer camp included fishing in a nearby pond, spending the evenings around a campfire, and the concluding "Gala Night".
When it came to go home, the sun was shining, and the children and young people headed home happy.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims at the gates of mercy
The ministrants from the chaplaincy of Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna went on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
They covered four stages together.
The committee of upper ministrants for St. Anna had decided to prepare for and go on a pilgrimage lasting several days to bridge the gap to the next pilgrimage to Rome for all ministrants, likely to take place in two years' time.
Various pilgrimage sites were discussed, and a decision was finally made to go to the bishop's city of Freiburg, where, to mark the holy year of mercy, this year the gates of mercy opened for this at Freiburg cathedral are a particular pilgrimage site.
16 children from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.
On the previous evening, Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and the pilgrims.
They took the train from Horb to the starting point of Villingen, where the Cathedral of Our Lady is found. They started their pilgrimage from the cathedral.
The individual day trips were framed by brief moments every morning and evening with various prayers, songs and written texts.
Even when they were out and about, the children took breaks at wayside crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from the pilgrims' songbook they had put together themselves.
The rectory of each parish they reached was available for them to stay in overnight.
At each stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for creating a delicious, nourishing dinner and breakfast.
The second day saw them head towards Gütenbach, via Furtwangen.
The next day, they set off on the section towards St. Peter, the most demanding section, seeing them climb around 500 metres in altitude in sweltering heat, and then descend again.
They earned the reward of barbecueing together by the swimming pond.
After the morning session on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive cloisters of St. Peter, they started off on the final stage to Freiburg.
The children gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afternoon, visibly relieved and happy, and passed through the gates of mercy.
A brief moment was taken to thank God.
The evening mass in the cathedral saw the children who had arrived at the pilgrimage site welcomed by Chaplain Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristry and the high altar.
The next day, there was time to look around the city, located in the region of Breisgau.
In the afternoon they took the train back to Horb.
At the end, all the participants agreed that the trip was characterised by spirituality and a strong sense of camaraderie.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.
But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.
And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll ahead of regional elections: SPD and CDU lose out
Ahead of the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses are looming for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU.
These are the findings of a representative poll carried out by INSA, a polling institute, on behalf of "Bild" newspaper.
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to continue in office, this will not be possible in Berlin, according to the poll.
However, the SPD was the strongest party in both states, with good chances of putting forward the head of the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent to 24 percent in five years.
According to the poll, this puts the party only slightly above the CDU, who had 23 percent.
The Left and the AfD will fight over third place.
The Left had 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), and, with 19 percent, the AfD could be in the regional parliament for the first time.
Despite small losses (from 8.7 percent to 6 percent), the Greens will return to Schwerin's regional parliament.
The NPD and the FPD, with 3 percent each, will not be represented in the regional parliament.
According to the poll, the SPD would only receive 23 percent in Berlin's elections to the House of Representatives (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).
The CDU would only take 18 percent, after having taken 23.4 percent.
This would put them behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left, with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time, with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FPD could hope to return, but the Pirates, by contrast, would miss out - unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago.
Its successors have now conquered the world - but its manufacturer is in the midst of a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, and harder to hold.
Indeed, it was quite bulky.
The in-built storage originally held eight megabytes - enough today for around two high-resolution selfies.
Now, an iPhone holds at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was released for sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
The device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet.
However, 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a couple of months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover, billing it as "the office you can fit in your pocket".
The new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax.
You could even access websites via a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow.
There was a calculator, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded open like a laptop.
This revealed a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was fairly high: 2700 deutschmarks, around 1400 euros.
In 2015, the average sale price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros.
In August 1996, nobody had any idea that the Communicator heralded the start of the smartphone era.
Today, everything has changed.
Smartphones are a success story - even if the same cannot be said for Nokia.
The mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
Today the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia.
For many people today, being online all day, no matter where you are, is simply a fact of life.
In 2015, there were around two billion smartphone users around the world.
Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone make up 555 million of them.
Global sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of innumerable app providers and telecommunications firms.
An entire industry has now sprung up around smartphones.
The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007, when the Apple CEO at the time, Steve Jobs, announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed easily via touchscreen.
Apple's triumphant march began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who used to dominate the market, lost out.
They eventually disappeared, and Blackberry had to fight for its existence.
Apple, and Asian providers such as Samsung, now hold sway.
20 years after their invention, smartphones are a fact of life.
Nowadays, every German looks at their phone an average of 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put our phones down from time to time," said Janina Kugel, Siemens HR Director.
Being permanently contactable has become a blessing and a curse.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This isn't a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star steps down
Alex Rodriguez' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.
After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on 12 August, against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I'm saying goodbye to both of them," the 14-time All Star Major League Baseball (MLB) player explained.
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
He signed a ten-year contract, which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - on full pay.
Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ago.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("runs"), for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005, the Yankees, he has reached rather a few milestones.
Along with Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, there are only two other baseball players who can boast similar key statistics.
However, the 41-year-old cannot be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fame.
Because no matter how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the pitch, his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversial.
As far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the "biogenesis scandal".
Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti-ageing clinic in Florida over a period of years.
After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I'd played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, summing things up.
Even his final days didn't go off without a bang.
While many baseball legends take to the great stage over their last few games, Rodriguez had to sit on the sidelines.
"My job isn't about a retirement tour."
"My job is about trying to win every game," stated Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
Nevertheless, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who has been rumoured to have been linked to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, had the support of the fans of Yankees' arch rivals, Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang as they were defeated 4:9 by Rodriguez' team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Busted: After a sample tested positive for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - the 2016 Olympic Games have been overshadowed by the first official cases of doping.
One now-banned athlete had almost won a medal.
The first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time.
The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used to mask drugs.
The international sport tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time that she had been banned from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the 100m Butterfly final - missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.
Chen was supposed to have taken part in the 50m Freestyle heats on Friday.
Chen applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a hearing and to have her B sample opened.
The national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision".
For the first time in history, the CAS, not the IOC, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive.
Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all of which were negative, and my fourth test was positive," which was "an unbelievable shock," she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance involved was the blood doping chemical EPO.
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and according to BNT, a B sample also tested postive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up immediately to criticise the athlete.
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been banned".
Almost all the weightlifters from the nation, which has been plagued by doping, were not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother.
Both deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg.
Ahead of the athletes' start, the case of Danekowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, China's earlier offence had caused heated disputes between the athletes themselves.
Camille Lacourt, from France, spoke out harshly against Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang's pee is purple."
"When I look at the podium for the 200m Freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
In addition, Sun was at the middle of an argument with Mack Horton, from Australia.
"I have no time and no respect for drug cheats," he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit out for a three-month ban.
Data theft: This is how perfidiously hackers extort ransom money
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - with success.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany by Malwarebytes, the malware defence specialists, 40 percent of the companies surveyed had fallen victim to one, two, or several attacks involving extortion software in the past twelve months.
In Germany, around 20 percent of the companies had already been targeted by a ransomware attack.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid up the ransom demanded by the perpetrators so that they were able to use their systems and data that had been affected by the attack.
According to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful in that domain, the ransom money they can demand is significantly higher than it would be for private users.
"We are currently seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper.
In 2008, most malware programmes were still focused on sending out adverts.
Then perpetrators discovered extortion software.
Private users were initially the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly over the past few months.
Ransomware follows a simple pattern: Once activated on a user's computer, it seeks out files that have not been edited for a long time, like Word, Excel or database files, as well as image and video archives.
The ransomware encrypts these files, and deletes the originals for good.
Finally, the software presents the extortioner's demands.
The victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files.
But while it's a personal photo database that's at play for private users, it's sensitive customer data or project databases needed for the continuation of projects that are the focus for companies.
As a result, the damage from a ransomware hit is greater.
22 percent of German companies affected reported that they had suffered a fall in turnover due to ransomware, 13 percent had to cease trading entirely, and in one instance, people's lives were put at risk.
In Germany, several hospitals have already fallen victim to attacks, and their patients were placed under serious threat as a result of the loss of medical records.
"We always tell victims not to pay up: that simply exacerbates the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get their files back.
Faced with operations coming to a standstill, it is hard for managers to say no to the perpetrators' demands.
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a good reputation.
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And while private individuals are targeted for sums of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to bargain hard and pay out five-figure sums to get their files back decrypted.
Faced with the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week."
However, it is more likely that three or four people will be involved.
The programmers then sell their malware to the actual extortioners in the form of a set of software building blocks.
Malware kits to date, including the malware itself, advice and additional tools, have been sold for a one-off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The kits include an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed, and the appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you just log into an underground forum, buy the set from a criminal, and task someone else with installing the software on as many PCs as possible.
There's a payment made for every computer infected.
"Normally, criminals then task spammers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.
Now, many companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better.
More than 50 percent of companies' IT specialists in Maywarebytes' survey relied on using file back-ups and scanner software to beat ransomware.
As a result, perpetrators are already trying out new strategies.
"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the risk potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of file.
In the future, perpetrators will be able to focus themselves on brand-new targets within the internet of things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the internet.
In the midst of winter, many victims would pay a ransom to have their blocked heating turned back on.
In the future, if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of someone's heating, ransomware could also be a issue in Industry 4.0.
Something for every situation
HONDA HR-V is practical and perfect for everyday use
Honda wants to cram everything into the small HR-V: a bit of an SUV, a bit of a coupé, bundled up with the versatility of a minivan.
It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does indeed prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use.
Although the HR-V, at just 1.60m tall, seems small, passengers in the front and the back have got plenty of room, it's not a squeeze at all.
The materials used in the interior are well crafted, and have a pleasant appearance - just the surface of the dashboard lets the side down.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space.
There isn't just a boot of 453 l with the seats up, and 1026 l with the seats down; there are the "magic seats" too.
This is rather less magical than it sounds: the seats in the back can be flipped up like cinema seats to reveal additional loading space, measuring 1.24 m from floor to ceiling.
The boot is easy to load, but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008, which is a comparable model.
The 1.6 l diesel engine we tested, with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR-V powerfully, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm across a wide range of speeds.
However, it could certainly do its work a bit more quietly.
Everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km was pleasing.
There is an additional motor: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 horsepower.
All-wheel drive is not available.
Its handling is balanced, a good compromise between speed and comfort.
The steering could be a bit more direct, however.
In the top-flight "Executive" version, which we tested, the fittings leave nothing to be desired.
The safety systems include city emergency braking assistant (functions up to a speed of 32), collision warning system, and the lane departure warning system.
The collision warning system is irritating occasionally: when parking, it sees lots of obstacles as "approaching objects".
The high-beam assistant system is very reliable.
And the intelligent speed regulator reacts to traffic signage, and reduces the vehicle's speed if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-range model: 7 inch touchscreen, satnav, app integration, and more.
There are two USB ports and a HDMI port under the armrest, which makes them rather tricky to access.
It costs around 29,000 euros for a top-of-the-range diesel model, which is fair.
If you don't want to invest quite that much, the petrol model is available from 20,000 euros, and diesel from 23,000 euros.
The motors comply with euro 6 emissions standards.
With the HR-V, Honda is offering a diverse car that is perfect for everyday driving.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger boarding bridge
An airline will not be liable for a passenger's fall on a passenger boarding bridge.
This is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel, the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The claimant had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was one of the ordinary risks of life, pronounced the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
When do organisers pay if illness strikes?
Travellers who fall ill will only get their money back when they return home if there is no doubt that their illness was caused by something within their hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of visitors can be proved to have suffered the same symptoms.
In this case, a family were stricken with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
They spent almost all their holiday in their room.
The holidaymakers blamed a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, which they believed to have polluted the seawater.
The family took the opinion that the holiday was unsatisfactory - and took the organiser to court.
The claimants had no luck in court.
It was true that the waste treatment plant was suffering from a fault.
But the organiser only found out about this just before the claimants departed.
Until that date, the organiser had to assume that the seawater was acceptable.
According to the judgement, the organiser had not violated its information obligation.
In addition, no contamination was found in water samples.
When several hotel guests fall ill - possibly by infecting each other - the court views this as a general life risk.
Only 38 of 691 guests fell ill.
De Maizière said that many people were worried about further attacks following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July.
He said that the state must react to the threat of terrorism with prudence and resolve.
One thing is for sure: Our country will not react to the perpetrators' violence with hatred and division.
We will not give the terrorists this victory.
If perpetrators have to leave the country quicker, that will boost security and increase the general public's approval of refugee politics.
De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented before the federal elections in 2017.
He also announced that security services would receive more staff, to the tune of "a mid-four figure sum over several years".
Advertising for terrorism must be punishable once again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, and gun laws to be amended so that purchasing weapons online, in particular, is made more difficult.
Doctors' confidentiality obligations, recently the subject of much discussion, are to remain, according to De Maizière.
However, he wants to talk to doctors to find solutions to reduce the risk to the general public with regard to mental illness, he said.
The Minister felt that improved social care was important to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.
Teachers must be better trained for dealing with traumatised individuals.
De Maizière is planning to employ undercover agents to hunt down criminals in particular areas of the Internet (the Dark Web).
SPD Head Gabriel said that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further".
He said it was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
"That was a slap in the face for agitators in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel on Friday to the newspapers of the Funke media group.
De Maizière had previously turned down calls from the coalition for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He views an overarching ban of full veils as problematic under the constitution.
You can't ban everything you're opposed to, and I'm opposed to the wearing of the burka.
We can talk about the law with regard to traffic, or for witnesses appearing in court.
Head of the Greens, Simone Peter, accused the Minister of wanting to use new anti-terror packages to create an air of energy and ability to act.
Head of the Left, Bernd Riexinger, said that "smooth talking and tightening up residency laws are not going to make the people in this country any more safe".
Better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road
Traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here's a photo from November.
But that is about to change: the right-hand turning lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers stuck in rush-hour traffic on the bypass every evening as they drive onto the motorway slip road (A43).
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the State Roadworks Office will extendthe right-hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit from Weseler Straße by 700 metres.
This means that drivers will be able to feed in directly from Hammer Straße.
The major advantage is that traffic will split earlier, improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51.
The CDU fraction in the Münster (West) district administration came up with the idea to lengthen the exit.
The traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm.
On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes even goes over it.
This is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.
From here, there is only a single lane of traffic over the motorway bridge.
The second lane was removed a good eighteen months ago.
The reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes, particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles.
The relevant authorities cannot say how long this bottleneck, and the associated rush-hour traffic, will last.
It's going to be a matter of years: officially, the bridge will remain in use until 2034.
The district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right-hand turning lane, because it will cause delays.
Traffic will be diverted past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: Cultural programme for schools
The international class from the forest school has been to see "The Invisible House" at the theatre.
The "Nima's" association and Young Theatre are now planning a musical project.
The "Nima's" association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "International Class" at the Kinderhaus forest school saw a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" at the Young Theatre in Münster.
Within the framework of the "Intercultural Journey" set up by Nima's, 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 saw the play in the small house.
The association's objective is to encourage cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds, and since the start of the year, it has offered schools with welcome classes with the chance to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most young people in the class arrived in Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreography, scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the plot regardless, according to the press release from Münster's Young Theatre.
Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre, will work on a musical theatre project together over the next season.
From October to December, young people aged between 14 and 20 with and without a migrant and refugee background will have the chance to attend professionally-led courses for singing, dancing, acting, and music.
There are also plans for acting and theatrical language training for children and families.
The "Intercultural Journey" project continues.
As a result of the increase in the number of refugees, the association is expecting that many classes will want to take part.
Rain replaces shooting stars: There is hope that the weather will improve
For people hoping to spot shooting stars in south-west Germany on Thursday night, the weather put paid to their plans - but all is not lost.
The President of the Observatory of Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning that the clouds and rain overnight meant that conditions were not ideal for observing the celestial show.
We are pinning our hopes on Friday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, so we'll definitely see lots of shooting stars in the sky.
The shooting stars are the Perseids: some of the quickest shooting stars, travelling at 216000 kilometres an hour.
Their name refers to the fact that they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which is visible in the north-east.
Silent night: Tips to fight sleep disorders
In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time morning comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off.
This is anything but relaxing.
If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they often or always wake up not feeling refreshed.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are various forms of sleep disorders, and they can have many causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, President of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What people generally understand by sleep disorders is insomnia: a problem with falling asleep and sleeping through the night.
Many people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Biological, psychological or behavioural factors can be to blame, along with medication.
A sleep disorder is often a reflection of another illness.
"Waking up very early is common with depression, in particular," says Weeß.
And it can be the case that several factors have an impact on each other.
If you have a slipped disk, for example, you might find it hard to lie down, wake up every couple of hours, and start to grumble about everyday problems and worries, suggests Weeß as an example.
That causes tension, and it is impossible to sleep.
When should you see your doctor about sleep disorders?
If, over the course of a month, you sleep poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß.
They can impact in various different ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches.
To be able to treat a sleep disorder, it is important to work out what is causing it.
Behaviour changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - with traditional sleeping tablets only being used in exceptional circumstances and for a maximum of two weeks - are all options for treatment.
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin.
As a result, you should first turn to your GP if you're suffering with a sleep disorder, recommends Weeß.
Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to a sleep lab, and what happens there?
Doctors recommend an examination in a sleep lab for patients whose snoring disrupts their breathing, for people who feel abnormally sleepy during the day, for sleepwalkers, or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be pinpointed, explains Fietze.
You don't have to prepare for the examination at all.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just - please don't take an afternoon nap," says Fietze.
After being cabled up, you head to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal cannula, a belt across your chest and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera mounted on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can those affected get a grip on the problems they are experiencing?
There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a better night's sleep.
Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching television to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all.
What the jungle camp has got to do with missing swimming medals
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.
In December 2014 he got his first gold medal at the Short Course Swimming Championships in Doha, while setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has come forward on Facebook to defend his ex-teammates from criticism.
"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle gets 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.
The remuneration system in swimming is poor, but doping tests, on the other hand, are very good, he says.
This means that we cannot compete with countries who pay a lot and that don't pay as much attention to doping, or even encourage it.
"I'm not saying that we should stop our tests," he went on to explain.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to register with the National Anti-Doping Agency for Germany (NADA) nine months before he started.
This is exactly how it should be with countries.
"If you don't submit to WADA/FINA checks a particular amount of time before the World Championships/Olympics, then you shouldn't be able to take part," the Hamburg resident stated, who now runs an ice-cream parlour.
Airport: A gang of luggage thieves are arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf airport
Plain clothes officers from Dusseldorf's police force managed to arrest two women and two men, aged between 50 and 61, on Thursday.
The suspects had worked as a group to steal several bags and items of luggage.
Around 9.30 p.m. civil servants in Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the police from previous thefts.
The two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid-July, and had committed the offences as a group, dividing up their work in a particularly professional way.
The specialists from the 34th police inspectorate were able to prove that the thieves, who had travelled to Germany to commit the crimes, had committed four crimes.
They had made more than 15,000 euros as a result.
Old buildings, a couple of little linden trees, and a few cobblestones among them: at first glance, Berlin-Friedrichshain's Rigaer Straße doesn't look as if it's one of the streets that the police consider to be among the most dangerous in the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you come across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop.
Someone has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house.
Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is already underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed.
Articles on this "trendy district", as the property company responsible has dubbed Friedrichshain, have been illustrated with pictures of burning cars over the past few weeks.
The reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events.
Berlin's Senator of the Interior Henkel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a "no-go zone" for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared on 22 June by 300 police officers, the police patrolled the area for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three vans, closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 94.
During this period, builders renovated the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house.
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, one day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were sitting on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence.
Near the house project there is a primary school and a kindergarten.
Far-left violence is not what worries most residents the most: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the district since 1999, and Jana*, who has brought three children up here, are mainly irritated by the police presence.
They share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a district that wants more police protection against left-wing vandalism.
The schisms that Berlin's Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up between the squatters in the house and their neighbours do not exist.
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. Even today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city.
Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including almost all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer.
While those on Mainzerstraße were cleared out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become more and more of a magnet for tourists and Berlin residents who come from all over the world: residents from GDR times and former squatters are now sharing their district with them.
This can be felt in the rents, which have climbed by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Rigauer are seen as symbols of this development: this is clear from their broken windows or freshly painted facades splattered by paint bombs.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year in connection with "autonomous left-wing violence".
One reason for not all neighbours seeing this as a problem could be that they are not directly affected by crime: according to statistics, almost all crimes such as bodily harm are directed against the police.
The majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a block of flats next-door to controversial number 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
She is calm about acts of violence: the people at number 94 are her neighbours, they certainly had nothing to do with it.
Even the notorious burning cars have not played a role in Rigaer for a long time.
The trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere".
Neugebauer chose to move to Rigauer Straße - and she chose to stay there.
This is also why it was so important to her that residents got their street back: back from the police, politicians and the media who suddenly started claiming how important the district was in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away: by impersonal new developments in old empty sites, which drive out old residents.
"They are freehold flats, and most people here aren't interested in that - people here generally aren't so well-off," she said.
"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction."
But what should you do when nobody listens to you?
Then everyone gets frustrated, including the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who have moved in and are irritated by paint bombs: The housing project and the left-wing scene are part of the district.
If you move here, you should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into an area full of pubs should know they can't really complain about the noise.

Urbach: Annika Deutscle is the new Commissioner for Refugees
Annika Deutschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.
She will also work on-site as a social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach since July.
The social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger.
She views herself as a point-of-contact for all involved: refugees, people from the working group for refugees, administrators, authorities, and anyone else.
Regine Kunde from the working group said that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now available to work as a jack-of-all-trades to help anyone experiencing difficulties.
That's what some people said when management posted the advert for the job - meaning it less in a mocking way, and more with reference to the number of tasks that were to be performed.
They were looking for a manager with people skills and communication skills, combined with years of experience in social work - a real jack-of-all-trades.
However, managerial work is not how she spends most of her time, Annika Deuschle says.
It is primarily about organisation, working on-site with people, even in the background, and networking, she says.
The 31-year-old has been in post for around six weeks.
She has taken the 50% job for a fixed term of three years.
It was high time," Regine Kunde said, that Annika Deuschle offered support to voluntary and full-time workers.
There are major problems, minor problems, organisational problems, problems with people, comprehension problems.
New containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße
For a while, one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified status.
Communes themselves are responsible for subsequent accommodation.
They have to house the refugees in their own properties or in rented properties.
Communes themselves have to bear the costs for constructing, renting or renovating this accommodation.
Responsibility switches from district administration to communes and job centres.
The problem: Properties are free, but not every landlord is prepared to let.
The search has been very difficult for a while.
De facto, the administration cannot find any private homes.
According to Deuschle, being reliant on private homes has not worked.
This is why the commune's homes need to be beefed up, as it is so neatly put.
Consequently new containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße.
But homes alone will not do the trick.
Perspective is the key word, and Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree on that score.
In addition to a fixed abode, internships, apprenticeships, school places, "one-euro" traineeship jobs and temporary jobs need to be found or set up for refugees and migrants.
"More jobs would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many people work in builder's yards or help caretakers, or do voluntary work - and that provides motivation in a very orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive public perception.
This is not "employment therapy".
Being active doesn't just mean working.
The day needs a fixed structure, Deuschle and Kunde say.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
Consequently there is a need to provide sports, contact to locals, and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
There is where the administration and volunteers can get involved.
She says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The length of time that processes take is a problem.
They have to explain to refugees that it will take that long, and that the time can be filled productively - for example, with language courses.
If someone feels that they can't help anyone in Urbach, that they aren't allowed to work, and that they are useless, they'll never integrate.
The clear majority are motivated.
But there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others.
All told, this is "a mammoth task".
A tricky question: After recent events, are the two women worried about radicalisation, even in a small commune like Urbach?
"No," Regine Kunde said clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining.
However, volunteers are already aware of this.
These issues are already discussed by the refugees.
They were afraid that the attackers would bring them into total disrepute.
"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," Regine Kunde said.
Many of them would like to stay in Urbach.
So full-time and volunteer staff have to keep an eye open for jobs in the town and across the region.
But they always have in the back of their mind that a new group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
Politicians shy away from answering this question.
It is unfair to show them volunteers on site.
"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," said Annika Deuschle.
The situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees.
Regine Kunde also makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date.
Currently they amount to around 100 people, predominantly young men.
But when people are in need, you've got to help them - and both women agree on that.
The political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers to be found there.
Schorndorf: Search for intruders made by helicopter
The police helicopter flew above various areas for about an hour - without success.
Two unknown men broke into an apartment in an apartment building in Lindenweg on Friday morning at around 8.50am.
The residents surprised the two men, who fled.
The two men were between 1.65m and 1.70m tall, probably wearing masks, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded tops.
They were heading towards the centre of town.
The police launched several strip patrols and a police helicopter to try and find them.
Without success.
It may be the case that the unknown assailants were recognised near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police launch investigation after bikers attack a snack bar
After an attack on a snack stand in Ulm, police have launched investigations against six suspects who associate with the biker community for a serious breach of the peace.
House searches had revealed evidence and drugs, the police revealed on Friday.
According to the police, around 20 masked men from a biker-esque clan had thrown bottles and stones against the window of the snack bar.
Afterwards, two customers were attacked, one of whom was slightly injured.
Then they fled.
Damage amounting to 10,000 euros was caused to the snack bar and the neighbouring building.
Investigators believe it was a dispute among Ulm's biker gangs, between a Kurdish gang and a Turkish gang.
Thüringen: Zeiss Meditec comes closer to reaching a billion in turnover
Strong demand for medical technology in Asia has boosted Carl Zeiss Meditec's turnover.
Over the first nine months of the business year that started in October, the company's turnover grew by 6.7 percent to 789.6 million euros, as the listed company reported on Friday in Jena.
Its business in Asia grew disproportionately, by 17.1 percent.
Profits before interest and taxes increased from 89.5 million euros to 110.5 million euros, according to the interim report.
The Jena-based medical technology company wants to cross a turnover threshold of one billion euros this year, said its Board of Directors.
Zeiss Meditec produces devices and equipment for doctors' practices and clinics.
The company is owned by the Carl Zeiss optics and electronics firm (Oberkochen), and employs just under 3000 people.
Munich 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city
A mental asylum, where today young people are said to meet.
A crypt chapel, where they are now digging tunnels for the S-Bahn.
Allotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich brings captivating stories to light.
It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date.
Anyone who has ever got worked up because the car's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that.
The historical maps of the digital BayernAtlas, an offering from the State Government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date – and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so informative.
Especially when one compares them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur newspaper have changed since the 19th century.
The digital BayernAtlas is a patchwork quilt that one doesn't quite recognise for what it is at first.
Within the large overview map, were worked in detailed maps for towns and municipalities, so-called original-lay-of-the-land sheets.
According to information from the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority, these came into being between 1810 and 1864 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria.
Their commissioner: Napoleon.
The French army commander had occupied Bavaria since the spring in 1800, during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria.
Napoleon wanted to gain an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey – naturally for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally retreated with the Treaty of Lunéville from 9th February 1801: it was the current neighbours who had the idea to create a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph propelled the project further forward, founding the "Topographical Bureau" – and with that, the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority.
The original lay-of-the-land sheet for Munich originates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison of past/present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital.
The city has stretched out in all directions and coalesced.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
Around 1856, Untersendling's houses are concentrated along what is today Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a ringleader of the Bavarian farmers' revolt against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but field – at first sight: upon zooming in, a more detailed small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered plots from the so-called "original record", from which the property tax was derived.
Today, it is no longer farmers who occupy small parcels there – rather, it is allotment holders of the "Land in Sonne" facility.
A large green area is apparent to the north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still actually a "Wiese" – a meadow – and not a concrete wasteland.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original lay-of-the-land sheet, in the area where today the borough of Au-Haidhausen is, one can make out not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the elevation "Auf der Lüften" – but can actually read in large letters "mental asylum".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, they once imprisoned people with delusions.
The Munich district mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" had come to life there in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution – the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the practice of chaining up the so-called mad men.
What is more, he forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been busying itself for an exhibition with the establishment.
Originally there was place for 280 patients; later this was expanded to 500 places.
At some point even this capacity was no longer enough – the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 1905.
The Isar Amper Clinic, East Munich, has been located there since 2006, one of the largest psychiatric units in Germany.
On the plot of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes.
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, and to the east, residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" nursery was built – in the architectural style of the original mental asylum building, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks.
Marienplatz was recorded as the "main square" in around 1856, and Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
One big one remains up to this day – at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial premises and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood in the Marienhof, where these days, preparations for the second S-Bahn main line are underway, with first digging to follow on 5th April 2017.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Pasture fence project is fundamental
The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year.
Members of the Bundestag for the CDU Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a first-hand view.
Representatives from the Fischerbach local CDU group met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Rechtgrabenhof farm, belonging to the Schwendemann family.
To start with, Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of pasture and 40 hectares of woodland, keeps 40 milk cows and just as many young stock, and accommodates five apartments of holiday makers.
Schwendemann says that, for him, there is no alternative to the "Black Forest milk" marketing channel he uses for the milk from his cows.
Only regional produce is served to the holiday-makers.
Since he is also BLHV chairman for Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "fundamentally important".
I can't make a profit on that kind of steep-sloping ground.
Grassland areas make for a lot of work, a lot has to be done with the string trimmer.
"We have to grapple with the conditions and with the topography here," stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over his parents' business and he manages this without chemical crop protection and fertilisers, even if it's not an organic farm that he's running.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the community has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy to have the Leader funding".
The farmers need support to the tune of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.
One hopes that with that, afforestation of the area could then be drawn out for a long while.
"The biggest asset that we have are the people who work in agriculture and who give thought to how to bring their businesses forward," stressed the mayor.
The farmers are often the target of criticism thanks to the funding.
Using the pasture fence funding, a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced off in 2013.
The areas kept open with these amount to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs, to the tune of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, and a quarter was borne by the community of Fischerbach.
The farmers were thus left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in the 16.2-kilometre pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job. Without farmers we'd not be able to function."
Peter Weiß is also standing firm: "First-class foodstuffs are produced here."
The Baden-Württemberg directive on countryside conservation (LPR) makes the government funding of pasture fences possible.
Its goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced-off area is not allowed to be farmable with a tractor (gradient of over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation.
For the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence project, an application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build just shy of 16 kilometres of fence.
The areas of land to be kept open equate to 35 hectares; the calculated costs amount to more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, with car parking charged at £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
In past two decades, an ever decreasing number of people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This is the conclusion drawn by scientists from the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimations, 167 lung cancer deaths a year can be attributed to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
For comparison, he referred to one of his own studies on this topic from 1994.
Back then, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
Home connections prove to be very complex
The building works in Villinger Straße are in full throw and "are more or less on schedule," according to the manager of the construction yard, Fred Heinze.
In terms of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since lots of things are hidden in the substrate that were not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which always disrupts building works, poses a big problem for the Stumpp company construction crew.
"The ignorance of car drivers around red lights and barriers is really huge," reports Heinze.
The street is closed off and only the public busses are allowed to drive through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been engaged in the works on the bridges for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting, for sure.
But luckily we were supplied with cold mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," explained Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Best-of-five continues
The president of the International Tennis Federation has failed with his big Davis Cup coup in the general assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the (for this sport) revolutionary suggestion to from now on play the Davis Cup singles over only best-of-three sets received just shy – by a whisker – of the necessary two-thirds majority in support.
The admittedly often very long, but for that reason also greatly treasured, five-set classics are therefore surviving in the traditional competition.
63.54 per cent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform; ITF president David Haggerty's objective was therefore only just missed.
"We respect the decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need change in order to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historic competition," said Haggerty.
There will continue to be work done to improve the competition.
After many objections beforehand already, the suggestion to hold the final at a neutral location did not even make it to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: so, in future, the finalists of the David Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year.
In order to keep costs to a minimum for organisers, the requirements in matters of training courts etc. are being simplified and the players will not have to give so many official media appointments ahead of the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their orders
Electronics-multi-talent Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
Up until now, he has withheld the fact that a portion of these customers have already cancelled their non-binding reservations.
Alongside the always triumphant figures for sales increases and the even more gigantic sales targets, with the announcement of the most recent quarterly financial statement, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time had to reveal another, less glamorous number: that of the cancellations for the new mass-market Model 3.
In recent months, Musk had frequently used those more than 500,000 pre-orders to talk up the new car, for which distribution is just starting.
Musk now concedes that of the 518,000 total pre-orders, 63,000 have already been retracted.
Critics had time and again pointed out that they were only non-binding reservations.
In cases of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000-euro (in the USA, 1000-US-dollar, and in Great Britain, 1000-pound) "reservation deposit" back in its entirety.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, conceded Musk in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of as of yet 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 – all models taken together – it is said to be 500,000, and in 2020, a million.
The demand is therefore clearly there.
According to Musk, a further 1800 reservations arrive each day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today is looking at delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – that's if Tesla manages to get its brand-spanking new production lines going, as of yet never tested in practice, without any major interruptions and at maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt whether that's possible.
Should there be major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For the company cannot then prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of the St. Hilarius Church
750 years of the St. Hilarius Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, invitations are being issued to a serenade in the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.
Due to its idyllic setting and beautiful view over the village, the historical site of St. Hilarius is a beloved place to tarry a while.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can let themselves be enchanted by this powerful place.
The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a one-of-a-kind rural jewel".
The St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in records in 1267 in the Württemberg register: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church for Tumlingen on it, together with the Bailiwick" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks.
According to the text of the official document, aside from the former parish church, a lordly farm also stood on the Tumlingen mountain, which itself owned the church, or the right of patronage, and not the other way around.
People therefore also lived there too.
As is apparent from the upper administrative office for Freudenstadt's description in 1858, the "mountain" was, alongside the lower village and the upper village that can just about be made out still in the appearance of Tumlingen today, the village's third, grand centre of settlement.
All maps from the time of around 1600 substantiate this historical reality.
The right of patronage arose out of the Early Middle-Age proprietary church law.
A lord who built and furnished a church and staffed it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was also able to bequeath this proprietary church right.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or nominate a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.
The larger of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then first chimed in 1692, but had to later be surrendered in the Second World War, in 1942.
During the 30 Years War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796, French troops made camp in the vicinity of the church.
They brought out the pulpit and the pews and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Up until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery in Tumlingen served as the last place of rest for Hörschweiler's dead.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On new year's eve of 1834, a storm cleaved the church tower and half of it collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was pulled down.
Only the dwarf tower that is still present today survived as witness of the church's 750-year-old history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Industrious Pensioners" care for the Hilarius site, as successors of Dieter Dockhorn.
As event organiser, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen are issuing invitations to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel, on Sunday 16th July.
It is being arranged by the Kepler Gymnasium, Freudenstadt, combo, with speeches from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Municipal administrator Hartmut Romann gave the closing words.
The programme starts at 4.30pm.
Last admission is at 3.30pm.
The serenade will be rounded off with drinks in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer's evening under the shadows of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows right up to forest," invite the organisers, emphasising the fantastic view.
The serenade will only take place in the case of dry weather.
The organisers are hoping for many backers in favour of preserving the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important to Tumlingen and to Hörschweiler.
The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen feel especially bound to take care of their local region, as serenade organiser Walter Martini reinforced.
Association wants to have wind turbine approval examined
"Boisheim wehrt sich", sees no legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the District Administrator.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to retract his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheimer Nette.
They say it was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time the approval was given on 30th December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in Bosheimer Nette, since at that time only one wind energy concentration zone existed in Viersen, on the city boundary with Schwalmtal.
Construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone has an exclusion against the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are said to prevent "asparagusisation" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had in fact passed a resolution for a second wind energy concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, through an amendment to the local land-use plan – but the Düsseldorf regional government had not approved it due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of legal planning requirements, the approval decision that was issued is still unlawful, and should therefore be retracted as well," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
The current state of affairs: the city council once again passed a resolution for the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the regional government is still pending.
Erkens: "Grant of approval for the construction of wind turbines on this site is therefore precluded by planning law."
The district confirms receipt of the call for action.
"The relevant correspondence was received by the district of Viersen in the last week," declared a spokesperson.
The district is taking it as a reason to investigate the matter afresh.
However, it is not expected to lead to a stop in proceedings.
With a view to the proceedings underway at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning construction of four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on a plot by Bosheimer Nette.
The company, in which the city of Viersen holds indirect participating interests, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-hectare site last year already.
The construction of the four wind turbines should cover the energy requirements of around 11,400 households – that equates to around a fifth of the energy requirements of all Viersen households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a share in a wind energy plant in Übachpalenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district).
In it, a woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were mildly injured.
The road remained closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich, practising accompanied driving in her car with her 53-year old mother, the accompanying driver, was using the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
Town and dealers plan "hometown shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to newly discover the shopping opportunities in their town centre in September.
The trade association and town authorities want to use the weekend of the 8th and 9th September to entice residents to a shopping spree in the town centre.
As chairman of the trade association Christian König announced, the "home-town shopping" weekend is meant to make customers aware of what offers their own town has available aside from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with local suppliers is thus planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, homegrown companies are to give showcases, with their apprenticeship places.
Furthermore, the businesses in the town centre are to invite people to come "midnight shopping".
The campaign is not only for residents of the town and the nearby region.
Adverts on the radio, an online video and printed bags that allude to the campaign weekend are in preparation, Christian König tells us.
Town authorities and the trade association are cooperating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The trade association and the town are thus entering a further stage of the "attractive town centre" project.
To this belong new offerings such as the first "active day" for the fountain festival along with Sunday trading, talks with all the traders and proprietors to induce people to actively participate.
Attractive offers on the Saturday and waiving of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, new and existing customer bases can be developed.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals too had lost sight of the town centre for shopping.
Ultimately, it all has to contribute to breathing life into the town centre – right up to landlords, businesses across the whole town and associations.
We have to overcome the lethargy with a network that has partly built up, König had said in the spring.
Brigit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce centre in Mühlhausen communicated that five Thüringen towns are taking part in the nation's third "hometown shopping" day.
Alongside Bad Lagensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day is intended to "promote appreciation for local trade and emphasise more strongly its importance for the common good of our towns," said Streich.
The campaign, under the leadership of the Chamber for Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also brings home that all citizens can themselves influence their immediate environment with their shopping behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion in US school
During construction works, there was a huge gas explosion in the school building.
Another nine people were wounded.
At a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have died and nine others have been injured, some of which seriously.
According to information from the fire department, one injured person was still in a critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died as a part of the school building collapsed during the explosion.
Someone initially classed as missing was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees at the school.
Authorities suspected works on a gas pipe to be the cause of the accident.
Being holiday time, only a few people were in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" propitiates Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf again focusses on a colourful and frivolous production, set against a giant, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner, complete with remains of the Wall and kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the DDR times, or the New York stock exchange.
In front is parked an open vintage Mercedes car, in which the Rhinemaidens pose like rocker girls, or alternatively, an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif – gold, power and greed – that runs through his production of the "Ring".
The three Rhinemaidens – sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner – work wonderfully together, as they did already in "Rheingold".
They saucily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), lug a body in the boot in Hollywood manner, and play the riotous clique.
Stephen Milling sings the part of the superbly nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.
The scene where he slays Siegfried is brutal.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) cops it too.
The audience thanks the ensemble with mighty applause.
There is a rapturous reception for Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who effaces himself and bows his hands, forming a Merkel diamond.
There is huge applause for the Festival Orchestra, who appear on stage for the first time – in casual leisurewear in view of the high heat.
The performance from Frank Castorf and his directing team had been awaited with excitement.
Even if in 2013 he had had to endure another hall full of shrill catcalls, five years later there were great cheers, which drowned out the isolated boos.
Festival head Katharina Wagner will likely have been delighted.
"Once can see that the audience has in some way grown into the "Ring"," she had said shortly before the performance from the dpa.
The audience has not only made a kind of peace with Castorf, but on top of that, an understanding for his point of view has grown.
I see positive results.
Max Menge works as volunteer
During your voluntary service year, you're working at many locations simultaneously.
What are all the different places?
Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, and once a week I help out here in Greven in the Möbelbrücke.
And I have also worked at the full-day school in their supplementary activities.
What are your experiences of that?
Menge: It is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people: with adolescents, with refugees, with young adults.
You are 26 years old now, so a volunteer with a late-calling.
How did that come about?
Menge: I did my Abitur exams.
And then I successfully abandoned, shall we say, a civil engineering course of studies.
I recognised that it is not right for me and that I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what do you do?
Do a social year, you can get an insight, can see what it is really like on site, in the thick of things too perhaps.
And was it like that?
Menge: I gathered great insights.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I will study in dual, probably do an apprenticeship as a welfare worker at the Herne child protective services and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.
Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different work locations during the voluntary service?
Menge: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where one is doing their voluntary service year.
One can do it from at the old people's home right up to in youth work – in all possible facets of social work.
In my case, it was very varied.
I was also sometimes at the open full-day schools, that is, for the afternoon care.
For me that was exactly the right thing, the thing that got me fired up.
I was able to recognise and see my own strengths, as it was really happening.
Differently from when doing the civil engineering studies?
Menge: Yeah, sure; here it's not about working out statistics.
One always has other people at the front of their minds, people who all have totally different histories behind them.
Whether it's a refugee or an adolescent who has been pulled out of their family – you always have to approach it individually.
Very interesting.
And they didn't have any fear of contact?
Menge: I'm not the kind of guy for that.
It is an area that gives one a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of friendliness.
There are negative moments too sometimes, but that's just life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.
Municipal council wants common room
In the end, the decision was clear: with two dissenting votes, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln passed a resolution for a common room in the future retirement home.
Ahead of the debate, there is an important piece of information to be had: the purchase contract for the as yet still needed plot section has been signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Admittedly it will still be a while until the plot, which up until now has belonged to the church parish, comes into the possession of the municipality, but nevertheless, there are now no longer any planning obstacles for the project that has to be materialised by a private investor.
That is why there is a debate concerning a common room.
One of the two investors that are still on board has offered to accommodate the municipality.
For a special price, it would provide a living space – of around 55 square metres – and an adjacent terrace with no less than 70 square metres on the ground floor.
What the management and the majority of the municipal council have in mind is not simply to set aside such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior citizens' accommodation, but for it to be open to the community.
Talk of a "knitting café" was making the rounds, for example.
The decision, which was already pre-determined last Autumn through the allocation of resources for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in an area for redevelopment.
The construction of a common room would be eligible for financial support, reports Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
So as to signal to the investor that no-one wants to put a spoke in their wheel, the proposed resolution makes allowances for the determination that both a saddled roof – based on the surrounding buildings – and a mono-pitch roof – which reduces the height of the eaves and makes the building more economical – would be possible.
An uneccessary addition, thinks not only Wilfried Sohmer.
If it helps: it passes through the committee unanimously.
It's not so easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf points to their many owned buildings that are not really being forged ahead, but instead they are going out of their way with the common room: "I have difficulty with that," she says.
Yvonne Staiger declares herself to be unequivocally in favour of the common room – but absolutely against an investment from the municipality.
She views that as a hidden subsidy to already wealthy, or even foreign, investors.
That is simply not true according to the counterargument, for by purchasing the plot they are not giving away any grants, but are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value.
Staiger's proposal, to split up the proposed resolution accordingly, has three supporters.
So, with two dissenting votes, they are sticking with the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up as follows: "If we pass the resolution as so, we make a huge step towards plugging a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with a car: Cyclist hurled onto the road
The 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car whilst crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to police reports, the 82-year-old from Langenfeld was travelling on his bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg cycle lane at around 12.20pm, coming from the direction of Hilden.
The senior citizen wanted to cross the lane of traffic up where the street Am Buchholzer Busch is.
A woman driving a car in the same direction gave way to him.
However, as the man from Langenfeld cycled onto the road, he evidently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car being driven by a 66-year-old woman from Hilden.
The man was hurled onto the road.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospital in an ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich have to do without David Alaba and Thiago for the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup is happening without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund.
With squad concerns, FC Bayern are travelling to Dortmund for the first competitive match of the new season.
The title-defender is missing seven of its pros in the Super Cup against the cup winners.
The squad concerns are getting even bigger for the German football record champions Bayern Munich ahead of the Super Cup on Saturday (8.30pm/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to also do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the Munich team is missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
Ancelotti blamed the physical state of his team and the lack of balance in their game for their five defeats in the past six friendlies.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
That has not been good recently."
However, the 58-year-old believes that they can improve their performance in the first official competitive game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team exhibits these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who is expecting a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German football heavyweights is captivating the fans.
With 81,360 spectators, the game is sold out, shared the German football league (DFL) on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the Harz
The nation's first "astral path" is to come to life in the Harz.
It is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory society.
There has been a planetary trail in Göttingen since 2003.
An "astral path" satisfies many Harz visitors' need for information, it is said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
Members want to set up plaques along the planned route and put information about stars and constellations on them.
In a first phase, until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
In the running are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber.
The information on the plaques is to be expanded upon online.
So good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
The astral path is later to be extended, step by step.
"Spectators will gain lots of useful knowledge on the astral path, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the society.
In addition, they will learn why stars have different colours, or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is significantly further away.
It will also teach which constellation a selected star is located in, and when the best time to see it is.
The society has been operating the highest observatory in Northern Germany, in the small mountain town of St. Andreasberg, since 2014 already.
The location in the middle of the Harz national park is among the six darkest regions in Germany, according to information from the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation.
One can regularly clearly see the Milky Way, and even the Andromeda Galaxy, from there with naked eyes.
The university town, on the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium friends' association, has had something similar to the astral path since 2013 – the planetary trail.
Starting at Gebhards Hotel in Goethealle, which forms the centre of our solar system, the planetary trail leads with its steles up to Hainberg and the observatory – as well as an "extra-terrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets – including Pluto, which was downgraded to a dwarf planet, at the end point – are set up at exact intervals and on a scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball with a diameter of 6.5 millimetres, while the sun, standing exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance covered by the planetary trail is a good four kilometres.
While the light of the sun needs around eight hours to reach Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So, pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The trek to the nearest fixed star would take another half a year though.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after burst tyre
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were injured, some severely.
According to initial reports, the driver of an Opel Zaifra lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30pm, shortly before the Marktbreit junction, after a burst tyre.
The car slid right into the embankment, where it overturned and then lay on its roof, on the grass verge.
The four passengers – two adults and two children – were, in part, severely injured in the accident.
While first aid was being given to the injured by the emergency services, the A7 was closed for around an hour in the northerly direction, before traffic was able to be led round the site of the accident in the left lane.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three at the back works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to kick off the season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was content with the first game of the season, and with the result too, were it not for the two own goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two own goals too many, and in Aue, we have to take better care still," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The line of three at the back is to be optimised even further in the Ore mountains.
And the Fortunas don't want to let in any more goals after free kicks either.
"In future, no-one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing) any more."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team manages better with the three-at-the-back formation, even after the experiences in the build-up.
"I don't know yet how we will play in Aue," said the coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoachmann is sure of himself, "because in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, we particularly have players in the back three in the half positions that can build well," said Hoffmann.
"However, a prerequisite is that we harmonise even better together and don't commit so many passing errors in the build up."
Naturally, Hoffmann is also travelling to Aue to win the game.
"Whether after one draw though one can talk of a failed start, I don't know.
The performance could by all means be okay," said Hoffmann.
"However, if we're standing there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk of a decent season kick-off."
His coach didn't want to hear any of that.
"I will first judge our start to the season after six to eight matches," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not wish to talk of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony team's game in Heidenhelm had to be cut-off early due to a storm.
"Now they are effectively able to start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffman believes that the players from Aue could perhaps even be somewhat fresher, since they don't have any difficult and full games like Fortuna against one of the promotion favourites resting in their bones.
"But they don't know 100 per cent where they stand at the moment," says the Fortuna central defender.
Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished Aue stadium as slight favourites.
"That we are going to sweep them away just because we can claim a place amongst the top six is ridiculous," says Funkel, whose balance sheet against Aue, with only one defeat in nine games, is thoroughly positive.
"There is no team in the second Bundesliga that one has to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To give such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous."
And Funkel does not under any circumstances want to see his players like that on Sunday.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
Right on target
The works on the three bridges of the L 108 road, between Lauterbach and Schramberg, are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach.
"We're doing very well for time – it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the department of road engineering and transport in the Freiburg local government.
In April, works began on all three bridges in need of refurbishment between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time.
The works are scheduled to be completed in October, and Leicht is certain that the timetable will be stuck to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete that is covered in red variegated sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is old by now.
In order to ensure their stability and road safety, the three structures now have to be thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of variegated sandstone.
Both were erected in 1939 and they are twelve and 10.60 metres high, respectively.
The bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now – as of Wednesday morning – been given a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-tonne-heavy so-called bridge parapet on its north side.
This fixes the boundary and is also used as a passenger path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge parapet is to be put in place on the south part of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian walkway is intended to then to run over that.
What is special about this is that is uses finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already kitted out with the patented bridge parapets.
Laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach required particular flair.
For a fibreglass cable also runs there, which many companies are connected to.
In the run-up to the works, residents were informed about the project via a leaflet.
Fish and crabs must also be fished out first.
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the lake reservoir in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane and regulated by lights.
For the construction works on the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge, where the "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" hotels are, is fully closed.
Altogether, the costs for the three bridge renovations total 700 000 euros.
The entire project is being funded by the state.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest with German potato salad
It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it concerns the Alternative for Germany (AfD), people come together who would otherwise be difficult to reconcile.
The parties who represent in the Vulkan Eifel district council (CDU, SPD, the Greens, FDP, FWG, die Linke) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully nailing its colours to the mast on this day because the AfD are holding a "big kick-off to the election campaign" in Gerolstein Town Hall plaza.
And are launching famous names – like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland makes up the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on 24th September, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch.
But those who have been on site for hours already before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD, but rather, demonstrate.
The motto: "Eifel is staying colourful."
Originally the town picnic was planned for Brunnenplatz square under the motto "everyone at one table", but now is taking place in the carpark beneath the shopping plaza – and therefore directly in sight of those coming to the AfD event in the Town Hall.
A colourful picture on show there.
And what really delighted Christa Karoli, chairperson of the Eine Welt (One World) Forum and one of the leading organisers: "It's great how many people have come together here."
There's music and all sorts of food, including a "typical German potato salad" that even the AfD would have no problem eating," said the woman who had brought it.
The police had summoned lots of officials to Gerolstein and were above all also present at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the event locations.
How did the AfD make it to Gerolstein, actually?
Mario Hompe from the Vulkan Eifel AfD reports that he strove hard to get such an event and that he won the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönndersdorf had originally inquired in Daun, but had got a no there because there were not enough parking places available due to the St. Lawrence funfair already being set up.
So now, the shopping plaza; Hompes is delighted that "we are able to hold such a wonderful event here".
With a view to the event on the plaza forecourt he says: "It's the people's right. The main this is that it stays peaceful".
And it does: at around 8pm some entertainment is provided, by a band on the plaza forecourt, and in the town hall, by various speakers, including Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 in attendance, waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch, to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour; the guests in the forecourt have a long wind, but even there it is time to clear up shortly after 9pm.
The police can go away – no specific incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
There is another chance to hear Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslach cloister concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he is giving a concert that carries the slogan "The Black Sea meets the Black Forest", or even, "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and awardees of numerous international competitions and hold soloist positions in leading European orchestras.
So, Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both have in common a passion not only for transcending the boundaries of their instruments but also for conflating the boundaries of the various genres.
So, Johann Sebastian Bach played by the two of them takes on a whole new sound, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suits" from JazzEcho prize-winner Nils Wogram, they blend classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating complete art work.
This centrepiece of the programme had its debut performance in Freiburg this spring, to great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and there's more: the Haslach monastery church, with its special acoustic, was consciously incorporated into the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything." This is what Kristen Stewart said in total frankness on the topic of her bisexuality.
"If I bite into grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'".
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was probably that with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, which came apart bitterly in the end.
Despite all that, the brunette actress assures "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated.
Or did you think I was faking it?"
After their split, Kristen came out as bisexual: "I've always really lived for that duality and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused me or held me back.
I just never liked being made fun of."
She suffered from this especially in her school days, according to "Bang Showbiz", when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really, really hurt me.
When I was eleven, kids told me I looked like a boy.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'".
She particularly doesn't like explaining her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that makes me angry.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the entire public."
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a memorial service in the north Hessen town of Fritzlar, around 1000 people commemorated both soldiers who lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under strict security precautions.
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) remained silent on the as-yet-unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two pilots who were killed as "experts in their field".
"We bow before this greatest of sacrifices that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from north Hessen lost their lives a week ago, on Wednesday, in the West African country of Mali.
Their coffins were transported back to Germany and on Thursday were brought to Saint Peter's cathedral in Fritzlar, accompanied by a wake from the German army.
At midday, the relatives first said their goodbyes in the church.
Then, amidst family and closest friends, the memorial service was begun by representatives of the German Army and the political world.
Among these were Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Inspector General of the German Army, Volker Wieker.
Memorial guests laid down roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.
The people of Fritzlar and numerous soldier followed the ceremony in front of the church on a big screen.
Defence minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in missions.
The Stabshauptmann is said to have helped set up flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six qualified Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs too, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, said: "If this crew were not able to prevent the crash, then no-one could have".
Minister von der Leyen did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.
However, it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two nations," she said.
After the memorial service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
The Germany Army did not wish to give any indications about when or where they are to be buried.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prinz Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family shared that on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are interred in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bildhauer Bjørn Nørgaard is already crafting a sarcophagus for the two of them.
The queen is content with her husband's decision, the announcement continued.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland.
Prinz Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
In 2016, he went into retirement and at the same time also laid aside his title of "Prince Consort".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function that he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife – not after death either, explains Lene Balleby, chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
Where the last place of rest will be in the end for the 83-year-old is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland, but rather in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a noble French family, he had got to know Margrethe in 1965 in London.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
Whereas the people's expressions of sympathy always flew to his then to be wife, Prinz Henrik had a hard time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything that I did was criticised.
My Danish was faltering, I preferred wine to beer, silk socks to wool socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco, and which had the reputation here for being the brand of intellectuals who were critical of society, I could not hope for any leniency.
I was different.
It seemed I was happy with this position and not ashamed of it.
Those were two errors!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a snap new election
CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's prime minister Stephan Weil (SPD) wants the State Parliament to have a snap new election after the loss of the red-green governing majority – but he doesn't want to step down.
Weil declared himself on Friday to be in favour of a dissolution of the Parliament.
Previously, the unexpected resignation of a Green party representative from her state parliamentary fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s government into a stark crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition lost in Hanover, and with that, their scant one-vote majority in Parliament over the opposition of CDU and FDP.
Elke Twesten, up until that point a Green Party representative, justified her move with the fact that she had not been nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she stated on Friday in Hanover.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his party to take her in.
Then the CDU and the FDP would together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament, and the Greens, 68 seats.
Up until now, that ratio was the other way around.
The new State Parliament will be elected as normal on the 14th January next year.
Thümler says that the red-green State Government now has to decide whether it can continue to govern in these circumstances without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it imperative that the State Parliament vote to dissolve itself as swiftly as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday about how they will proceed.
The state constitution also allows for the possibility that the State Parliament declares no confidence in the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers various options.
The possibilities have to be examined in a proper legal way," said Thümler.
"All aspects will be debated in good time, if they are examined in a sound legal way."
Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious though".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the defecting representative to give up her seat in Parliament.
"We naturally assume that she will give up her seat in Parliament, which she won on a Green party ticket, with immediate effect," communicated state chairpersons Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Green Party chairwoman Anja Piel said: "We exceedingly regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She consciously decided not to give any statement in the parliamentary group.
"Especially given the background, that there were no essential differences – we can't understand this move."
SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz denounced the crossing over of Lower Saxony Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green representative in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal to red-green," wrote the Social Democratic federal leader on Friday on Facebook.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s decision to let the State Parliament have new elections soon.
Twesten's resignation costs Red-Green the majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration" put "her personal interests above the wellbeing of the state," critisised SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony plays along in this dirty scheming and attempts to score political points from it."
Lower Saxony CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his representatives to take Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Opperman, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the State election in 2013 with her personal career notions.
The CDU was then the strongest power ahead of the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the State Parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in interview – How do we protect ourselves against poisoned eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How was it possible for the scandal to happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers our questions in interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look very carefully at the eggs in their fridge and check the stamps printed on them.
The federal states are each supplying their most up-to-date information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at this point in time, a health risk is all but ruled out.
Is Aldi now adopting the best possible reaction to the crisis – removing all eggs from their offering – because the Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture is not really playing the central role of providing clear information?
Monitoring foodstuffs is a task for the federal states.
Despite that, the ministry immediately connected and has been liaising closely with the state authorities ever since it became known that Germany was affected.
All information and the risk assessment are accessible to consumers.
It is up to the trade just as much as it is the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold meet trading requirements and do not present any health risks.
For eggs, if the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded, then they do not meet trading requirements.
Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time the businesses are not at fault.
Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat?
According to what we currently know, the production facilities are not in any way directly to blame.
In fact, due to suspected illegal practices by service companies, they have to deal with commercial claims.
As always in emergencies, there are too few inspectors.
Is it just the number of staff that is lacking, or the key competence as well?
It was actually the official controls themselves that exposed what was going on.
However, we must also remember that food fraud and criminal activity can never be 100% eliminated.
It is for precisely this reason that it is so crucially important to have such occurrences thoroughly cleared up and passed over to public prosecutors in cases where crimes could have committed.
I have already made it clear many times that I am expecting a complete resolution from the authorities in charge.
Is the alarmism that regularly arises with food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to get only safe food that is approved for market.
If a prohibited insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are quite right to be indignant.
Thanks to these adulterated products, manufacturers, retailers and consumers get into a situation that is entirely unnecessary.
Fundamentally the following has to be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the farming of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately.
Work must be done on this consistently and urgently at all levels.
I expect all responsible authorities to clear up the matter swiftly and completely.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is on the look out for a new choccy supplier
In the last few years, Chocolat Frey has made on-board chocolates for Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end: the airline is inviting new calls for tenders.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, in response to a query from news agency sda, confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year of 2018.
The products would be reviewed and undergo a quality control every two to three years.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Every year, around 17 million small 14-gram chocolate bars packaged in red and white are handed out by the flight attendants to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not wish to make any statements on the costs.
According to "Nordwestschweiz", industry insiders estimate the order volumes to be 1.5 to 2 million francs – the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around a billion francs.
However, more important is always the advertising effect: for a chocolate producer, it is a prestigious contract.
Swiss will not disclose how many bidders there are for the new call for tenders.
However, only Swiss producers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018.
The biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available to the sda for a statement.
Swiss has been handing out chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate bars, in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of inserting a logo two and a half years ago, at the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline collaborates with various Swiss chocolate manufacturers.
On long-haul flights, the first class customers are spoiled with treats from confectioner Sprüngli; in business class, passengers nibble on chocolate from Lindt, and in economy class, chocolate from Chocolat Frey.
On short-haul routes too, Swiss hands out chocolate from Chocolate Frey, both in business and in economy class.
Track-and-field discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches the World Championship finals
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the finals on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion in 2016, had been unsuccessful in the national World Championship qualifier and could only watch the discus contest from the stands.
Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski also qualified for the final showdown with his first attempt, throwing 65.13 metres.
Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
Blow dealt to drug mafia in the country
The police have delivered a successful blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, numerous properties were searched in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, said the Konstanz public prosecutor's office on Friday.
In the course of this, 15 accused, aged between 25 and 77, were detained and already had arrest warrants issued against them.
In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were detained.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspected Italians.
Both of them were therefore presumably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, over 300 policemen were deployed.
The mafia members were charged with organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Konstanz public prosecutor's office has been investigating the drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 already.
There was an active exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators from Rottweil CID had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
The major operation on Wednesday morning was thus attended by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations then turned their sights above all to Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27th May in Hüfingen, during which several shots were fired into a restaurant in the early morning, is also likely to have been caused by the gang.
Weise complains of big holes in the Register of Foreign Nationals
"Data for citizens that ought not to be showing up there": according to a report, the Register of Foreigner Nationals in Germany is exhibiting significant defects.
This is leading to some grave mistakes in decisions within asylum procedures.
Frank-Jürgen Weise, the official appointee of the German Government for the management of refugees, has brought attention to big holes in the Central Register of Foreign Nationals, according to one media report.
Defects in the data registered there could lead to "some grave mistakes in decisions" when it comes to asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis received by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to that information, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, among whom around 5.7 million from non-EU states.
The data are managed by around 600 Foreigners' Registration Offices in Germany.
Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained, it said, the quality of the data has in part not been good to date.
In some cases, data from 1921 was found, "from people who have long been dead, or from citizens who became German nationals and actually should no longer be showing up in the register."
"Erroneous data entries can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
Moreover, within the statistics on those people who are obliged to leave the country are recorded EU citizens, who do not at all have to leave.
Such false categorisations, however, led to "a biased debate about how to deal with those who are obliged to leave the country," it says accordingly in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German Government has apparently begun to send back to Italy refugee families with children under 16 years of age, if this is where they entered the country from.
This is emerging from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
In the paper, it says that the BAMF has been once more transacting such procedures "that concern families with children – with the exception of infants and very small children – to Italy since 1st June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, that had practically no longer been possible, says the newspaper, pointing to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Regulation, it is the EU state the refugee first reaches that is responsible for them.
If a migrant travels further into another EU country, this state can send him back to the country he entered from.
As a means of justification, the office writes: "By now, the intake capacity for families with children who are minors has significantly increased in Italy."
Italy has provided guarantees for the intake and accommodation of families.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) itself considers these pledges to be sufficient.
Other EU states too would send back refugees there using the scope of the Dublin Agreement.
The Linke party's spokeswoman for domestic poicy, Ulla Elpke, criticised this decision: "Due to shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with conditions of admission that contravene human rights and with risk to the child's welfare"
Second-best result achieved
Altogether, the blood donor service made 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for others.
At least, from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.
Ahead of everyone is Jürgen Greule, who has by now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
The community traditionally acknowledges the repeated willingness to give blood in the meeting of its municipal council.
"It is ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we show respect to the donors who make their blood available for strangers, and so selflessly," stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps multiple people," explained the district head of the on-call service of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the reserves are broken down into their components.
So, as many as three people could benefit from a single blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the campaigns that are to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, we achieved our second best result ever, with 114 donors," said the DRK on-call district head.
Obviously the move into the theatre venue a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Already before then, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were numbered amongst the repeat donors and honoured for having made 50 donations each.
Half as many were clocked up by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Reixinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most-wanted criminals receive post from Europol
As the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is being requested and hoped for.
Police across all of Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the sought-after serious criminals are not known, they are hoping and asking for tips from the population.
Europol reported on Friday about the campaign, which follows on from the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from the winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives hide out in holiday destinations, was the word from Europol.
21 postcards for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries have been assembled.
The website www.eumostwanted has existed since 2016, and has been visited more than 2.5 million times.
It has so far been possible to arrest 36 of those being sought online; at least 11 of these are due to tips following publication on the internet site.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is being turned into the Waldhotel Luise.
The house just outside Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and should be opened again on 1st March next year.
That is good news for the city.
For when the Hotel Birkenhof was closed by former operating company Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014, at the time around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, and with that, the income from the visitors' taxes.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who were coming into the rural district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective housing, which sparked controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by preparing development plans to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision passed in the municipal council back then without controversy.
Yet Freudenstadt's lord mayor, Julian Osswald, in particular, defended the hotel location and already back then spoke of serious interested parties in the establishment.
And he was right.
The Luisenhotels Group, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to being an establishment in the three-stars-or-more category, under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four establishments including the Freudenstadt property.
Two of them are in Bad Bergzabern, and one is in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and, now, Waldhotel Luise.
There has been a skip standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time now, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear just how extensive the refurbishment works are that are being undertaken.
The floors have been ripped out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bath tubs taken out of the rooms.
The entire hotel building is one big construction site.
There is still a lot to do before March.
"It is truly a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our paper.
Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are being kitted out with large, walk-in showers, the entrance foyer is being revamped, new windows are being installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully in touch with the people", is how Thomas Scherer expressed it.
"We want to make a gem of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
One doesn't want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but still at an elevated downtown level, stressed Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its roughly 60 rooms, wants to set itself up for a broad audience, explains Scherer further.
Individual holiday-makers, groups, and business people, should all feel at home in the hotel.
Scherer said that he had already had conversations with Lord Mayor Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause.
The city's expectations are said to be in line with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same page."
Asked about the level of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to commit himself precisely.
A little under a million euros, he reckons.
The outside facilities are also being revamped – that can already be seen.
In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is taking shape, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US Special Counsel convenes grand jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have convened a so-called grand jury, according to one report.
The panel started work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal", relying on sources intimately acquainted with the matter.
The newspaper judged the step to be a sign that Mueller has broadened and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that the panel has already issued its first subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret service has long been accusing the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
Several men who acted as Republican advisers during the election campaign are said to stand at the centre of the investigations.
According to reports, Mueller has been subjecting Trump's private and business circles to more and more scrutiny.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel has personally shifted the centre of focus onto Trump and is investigating the charge of whether or not the President could have obstructed the course of justice during the affair.
It is the main task of the grand jury to review the available evidence in cases of possible felonies and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are for this reason also called prosecution chambers.
They are usually engaged for major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel may also be engaged by the public prosecutor's office to subpoena people for questioning under oath.
According to the broadcaster CNN, subpoenas have already been issued in relation to a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who had been involved in this meeting had been summoned to give evidence, the report said.
They were also supposed to make documents available.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the convening shows that Mueller will not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly, should that be necessary.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury is ultimately being engaged in order to decide whether to bring charges.
Nevertheless, the convening of the panel signals the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and gives President Trump a new cause for concern.
In the midst of these new revelations, the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening in order to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," said Trump.
He said the subject gives Democrats an opportunity "to feel better when they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the convening of a grand jury.
But it usually operates in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the Special Counsel in a "fair" way.
Former head of the FBI James Comey said three times that the President was not under investigation, he said.
There is no reason to presume that anything has changed, his statement continued.
However, Mueller was only engaged after Trump had fired Comey.
Due to the sacking, accusations were raised that he wanted to obstruct the course of justice.
Comey stated before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to put an end to the investigations into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President was under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
As the US media portrays it, the White House gathered materials against the Special Counsel and his colleagues.
This gave rise to speculations about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent Special Counsel of Congress, such as, for example, in the Watergate scandal concerning President Richard Nixon, who later stepped down, Mueller is in a position where, in theory, he could be fired by the justice department if the President pushed for it.
However, various senators, from both parties, want to avoid such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed draft legislation on Thursday that would make it no longer so easy for the Special Counsel to be dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts into the Antarctic
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.
The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven communicated this on Wednesday.
The over a trillion-ton-heavy and 5800-square-kilometre-big colossus is now drifting to the north and will probably need two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the last three decades.
It does not pose any danger for men.
The extent to which climate change had a part to play in the iceberg breaking off is unclear from the research scientists' findings.
Nevertheless, altogether, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years now, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background fact report.
Many researchers believe this could be connected to global warming.
The now detached colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thereby grows out ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The equilibrium between growing and breaking off became disrupted north of this ice shelf a few years ago.
An entire ice shelf crumbled there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is in danger too, for the front edge has never retreated so far back as it currently is.
What is more, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and icebergs do not raise sea water levels, since they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it itself produces after melting.
However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers feeding directly into the sea, and being able to flow out much faster than before.
The could potentially raise sea water levels, though only to a small degree, writes the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic (Midas).
According to information from the AWI, the Larsen C ice shelf, at almost 50,000 square metres, is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.
It is up to 700 metres thick where it meets the mainland, and around 200 metres at the front edge to the open ocean.
It regularly breaks off there.
"Although this is a natural event, and we’re not aware of any direct link to climate change, this puts the ice sheet in a very vulnerable position," says Martin O'Leary from Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest back that it has been since records began," he also confirmed.
There is disagreement among scientists as to whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or whether it is receding long term and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, nevertheless, very many ice shelfs in the Antarctic Peninsula have crumbled in recent decades.
This long tail of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the research programme the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperatures has contributed to this decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees in the last 50 years and is amongst those areas where temperatures are rising most quickly.
CDU want in-house wage agreement for staff
Since it is getter ever more difficult to fill the positions that become available, the CDU is calling for secession from the employers' association, so as to become more attractive.
Shortly before the Summer recess, the district assembly rubber-stamped 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 permanent staff members and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees once more have their first working day behind them.
The apprenticeship positions at the district are apparently very coveted.
There were around 620 applications recorded for the places on offer this year.
However, the district is lacking additional personnel which it needs to overcome growing demands and duties.
Currently there are 50 positions at the district of Mettmann that are still unfilled.
Sought after are, among others, doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to seize the initiative in the district assembly and counter the dearth of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to "work out a plan for acquiring and developing staff," in line with the wishes of the parties.
The plan is not only to satisfy short-term demand in skilled workers, but, with a view to the future, to counteract the shortage of applicants, it is reported.
The entire concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for lateral entry employees, and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
Well that does sound like a good approach.
For the district has staffing problems, the likes of which it has not seen before.
Other cities poach good officials and staff members and offer attractive conditions.
The talk is of a downright "contest between public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees are leaving service due to illness or age.
High time to act then, so that not even more positions remain unfilled.
Yet Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, is, with his party, going even beyond the joint request.
Just recently he caused a huge surprise in the district assembly when he publicly called the staff capping into question and startled the other parties.
Völker wants all avenues to be examined that enable a secession from the municipal employers' association.
"If we don't reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive with the unions – perhaps also in collaboration with the district's towns – to secure an in-house wage agreement," said Völker.
The CDU are thereby attempting to pay the permanent staff and officials better than the pay-scale for public sector workers actually allows for.
Salaries are currently prescribed exactly, and there are only raises or more money when moves into a more senior level, which is based on years experience.
Yet the district's tasks have expanded more and more in recent years.
For the first time a few weeks ago, new premises had to be erected for staff to tackle the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.
Not least because of the growing number of applications for asylum, County Commissioner Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Ascents and trials
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost", and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and attractions.
Three chummy guides were on hand for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led along the vineyards, amidst hot summer temperatures, to the Chapel of St. Michael above Deidesheim.
There followed viewing spots, some on towers, from which one could look far and wide over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were time and again long uphill climbs, for which long trials were the reward.
On the second day, they went to Bad Dürkheim, to the salt works and to the Wurstmarkt festival.
Again, there came vantage point after vantage point, strung together with "flowing" trials and moderate ascents.
On the last two days, lots of high altitudes were on the cards again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment cabins brought welcome pauses.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing salt water in the open-air inhalatorium.
They headed for Neustadt too.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres in altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side – sporty and cultural.
Console instead of turf – Bundesliga is getting ready for e-sport
Will the sports stars of the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of battling sweatily, come wind or rain, on the stadium turf?
The fact is, e-sport has long been a credible industry, a lucrative business – big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments, complete with big salaries.
Even the top Bundesliga clubs have recognised this, and are getting more and more involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg took the lead in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04, and most recently by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in the middle of July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.
"By doing this, we hope to get completely new, young target groups fired up about the VfB,“ says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that countless more clubs are getting on board this train."
The world football association, FIFA, is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" this coming weekend in London, which will see gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
Alongside Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified, to give some examples.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual footballers.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14-30 year olds, so that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs are trying to conquer all possible markets, above all the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportspeople under contract, it would be possible to be present online in these markets vastly more often than the mere once a year the national team gets sent to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the football simulator FIFA are battled out on a competitive level.
Just like in the regular sport, leagues have long been established, in which the pros compete against one another.
And for the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it even a real sport?
For many people, this notion certainly takes some getting used to.
Ingo Froböse also grappled with this question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University of Cologne, e-sport is a sport, because it is competitive and features many biological and physical reactions that one also finds in classic sport – for example, a raised heart rate, stress responses, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive capabilities, technical and tactical understanding and an ability to react quickly.
Professional gamers ought to train not only on the console, but also their bodies, and should pay attention to their diet.
"A fit player is a good player."
Froböse sees problems too though: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue".
For online games it is difficult to implement testing, and the scene is lacking the structures of the classic sport.
The scientist positively stresses the highly integrative effect of e-sport.
The players travel internationally, it is like a big global family, and there are no intercultural barriers.
A study from consultancy firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for the e-sport.
In 2016, it turned over 50 million euros in Germany, many through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.
In three years, the turnover should total 130 million.
Compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga that is admittedly scant.
However, the e-sport is "no longer far off other established sports like handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
Many countries internationally are already further ahead.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the e-sport bookmaker Unikrn.
In Europe too, quite a bit is happening.
E-sport has been introduced to the curriculum in a Norwegian school, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the top division football clubs are now committed to setting up an e-sport department, according to Dutt.
"Compared with the rest of Europe, Germany is lagging behind," declares VfB board member, Röttgermann.
Simply to slide back into nostalgia and romanticise the old days is no longer enough these days.
It's about preserving the tradition of the club while at the same time aligning the business with the modern market.
"We are living in a digitalised world," says Dutt as well.
"So you can't cling on to the idea that only in football, everything stays as it always was."
Farewell poisoned eggs! The egg alternative for cooking and baking
By now, almost every Federal State has been affected by the scandal concerning poison-contaminated eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and withdrawn all eggs from sale across the whole of Germany.
Only eggs that are proven not to contain Fipronil are to be stacked onto shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to take to the field as captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern thinks the Confederations Cup winner is capable of a big season – a bit of extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different there at his place in the dressing room; Joshua Kimmich noticed that immediately, even if the extra piece of kit was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm anywhere to be seen, and no Manuel Neuer either, he simply put the band he'd been allocated on his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it", explained the Confederations Cup winner later, after his first outing as Bayern captain.
Sure, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli.
But Kimmich could also interpret the signal from the coach as follows.
Out of the C team of youth players, debutants and pros just back from the holidays, it was not the eight-years-older Arturo Vidal that was chosen as captain, but him.
Indeed, it is those that one thinks capable, those who one wants to keep happy that one likes to give treats to the most.
And anyone chosen to take on the mantel of Lahm can do only too well with a little bit of extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That is what one wants as a player: to take on responsibility."
The 22-year-old darted over the field like a mini Lahm on Wednesday.
Right back, that's his position now; the white armband cast its habitual spell.
And in general, Kimmich looked in this starting formation like one who is best able to take to the helm.
He gave instructions, attempted to steer the out-of-practice troop.
He had an eye for the bigger picture while many others were busied with themselves.
Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (didn't really work); Renato Sanches to live up to his performances of the Asia trip (worked, but to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not make a negative impression on their first outings in the Bayern jersey.
That worked out quite well though.
Süle took to the field alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence – both performed excellently.
The renowned Napoli attack often made heavy weather of it, and on top of that, Süle made a couple of successful attempts as the game developed.
His team mate, Rudy, admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for".
But he too showed a decent performance on his debut.
Shifting play, changing pace: "That's the style I was brought in for".
Just how unused to new arrivals this Bayern world is could be seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but as many as six or seven interviews in the tunnels.
Kimmich took his leave after a few crisp remarks in support of his new team mates.
There was an interesting sentence to be heard from Süle there: "I've already noticed what went wrong here.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
He doesn't have to teach the newbies that anymore though.
Alaba motivates the ÖFB women
David Alaba believes our ÖFB women will be successful
Austria's most famous footballer spoke up shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB women all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is, after all, practically a club mate of the ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck, and cheers our ladies on.
The tweet from the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner was intended to give a special injection of motivation.
Our ladies could perhaps also do with a bit of that famous Bayern luck.
Companies happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Industry praises Wissing's speed
The relationship between the state and local industry often proved irreconcilable when Evaline Lemke (The Greens) was still Rhineland Palatinate's Economic Affairs Minister.
This is evident after more than a year of the new Economic Affairs Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP) being in office.
Chambers and companies from the region are responding to a TV enquiry by speaking of a change in economic policy – and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the association of Trier companies Vereinigung Trierer Unternehmen (VTU) says: "Wissing is addressing the wishes of the industry, all of which Lemke blocked."
Natus considers the biggest U-turn to be in infrastructure policy: linking the A1 motorway between Kelber and Adenau is now right at the top of the state's list of priorities.
The Ministry hopes that planning procedures will be in place this year already, and the construction rights should hold until 2021.
The Trier western bypass also plays a role in the state's plans, being in the priority need category of The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan.
The goal is to put the stretch into service in December 2020, says ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees in this a roadmap for supporting regional, but internationally competitive, companies.
The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving, as spurred on by Wissing, to achieve a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the last ten years of sagging German wine exports.
In addition, Wissing is said to have a sympathetic ear for people who want to found their own company, the IHK applauded.
The Trier Chamber of Trades sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master craftsman examination, and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master craftsman training.
The state's list of homework assignments remains long though.
Facts have to presented quickly for the road construction planned, and at the same time the state is lacking the necessary human resources, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Trier IHK.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to employ at the Federal State Office for Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled thus far.
The IHK is pressing for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Deputy leader of the CDU parliamentary faction Christian Baldauf points to calculations from the Court of Auditors: in 2017 and 2018, the state is investing more than 20 million euros less on maintaining federal state roads than recommended.
Frank Natus is also still expecting the state to put forward a policy as to how it wants to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region.
Also sobering is the expansion of broadband in the state up until now.
In 2016, in an IHK survey, local companies had evaluated the mains supply with a mark of only 3.4.
They complained about sluggish internet connections and outages.
Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of wind energy company Pro Wind.
Lemke left the Green party in April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe – from where, after four months, she has already bid a retreat due to disagreements.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
The raft on the Isar had this message on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that visitors to Isar play their part, a raft travelled through Munich on Saturday morning with a special message.
Anyone drawn to the Isar again on Saturday will see a large raft there, between Flaucher and the Reichenbach bridge.
An no normal raft that is, with Isar tourists.
Rather, the building department wants to get a message across.
There is a large information banner to be seen on the raft.
It depicts a mountain of rubbish.
The prelude to a publicity campaign that wants to call upon visitors to Isar.
Using the motto "True love is...", the aim is to strengthen understanding for the Isar as a wild river deserving of protection.
Last summer, the raft travelled over the Isar already, and this year too, there are further campaigns and measures to bring about thoughtful and environmentally aware behaviour.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughing in the face of sorrow
Mordillo was for a while one of the most-published cartoonists; his figures' bulbous noses are his trade mark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and is working on a film.
His message: Laughing, "Because there's too much sorrow in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4th August 1932 in Buenos Aires, the son of a Spanish immigrant.
In his first years as an artist he struggled along as an illustrator for celebration cards, amongst other things – which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
Following posts in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60s he finally got his breakthrough: when his cartoons were published in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" as well, and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist always let himself be inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort around in his drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he sits at his drawing desk, still today according to his own statements, and works almost ten hours a day.
On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, soft toys and clocks, his whimsical figures are still disseminated widely around the world.
In addition, he has been working for six years on an animated film and a TV series with his figures.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe – Mordillo's favourite animal in his drawings – who has a millipede as his nemesis.
His figures are speaking for the first time in the 3D film, which should hit cinema screens in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they are going to say; it is odd for me," says Mordillo.
The screenplay was not written by him.
Therefore he is focussing rather on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is being produced without words.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön Mountains is today celebrating its 1200-year anniversary.
The highlight of the festivities will be this Saturday and Sunday, with a Medieval festival.
On these days, you should be able to experience grocers, guilds, merchants, vagrants or a Landsknecht camp in the town centre.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
In the storm: pile-up on the A8: four injured
Serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: just shy of 30 vehicles were caught up in a mass collision.
There are numerous people injured, kilometre-long queues – and rubberneckers.
On the motorway between Stuttgart and Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured late on Thursday afternoon in a mass collision.
According to initial police information, just shy of 30 vehicles, among which were probably also lorries, had crashed into each other during a storm at around 5pm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (in the rural district of Aichach-Friedberg).
No information is initially available about the precise number of injured people.
There are mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.
There was a big squad of rescue vehicles at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
A roughly 10-km long tailback formed in the direction travelling towards Munich.
As an AZ journalist reports, there were massive disruptions in the opposite lane as well – due to numerous rubberneckers.
The fire brigade noted down the registration numbers of the drivers, who are now expecting severe penalties.
Shortly after 6.45pm, there was then a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
A collision between a car transporter and a passenger car had occurred.
A rescue helicopter was underway to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Company trials "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that practically everyone has experienced at one time or another: without expecting it, you're sitting in the train asleep.
Or one is buried deep in one's work and has just had a genius idea.
And then: bang.
The conductor comes and rudely awakens you, or tears the passenger from the midst of his workflow.
Ticket inspection.
But the days of being interrupted will soon be over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently trialling conductorless ticket inspection.
One simply uses one's mobile to confirm that one has taken one's seat, thereby validating the ticket.
Trial operations are currently running on two lines.
"If the service is well-received, we'll extend it.
It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many additional long-distance lines across Germany," said a spokesperson for the railway.
The railway is calling this conductorless ticket validation "Comfort Check-in".
In order to use it, however, a few conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket – which most passengers do already anyway.
In addition, you have to have bought it over the Railway's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket in any case.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
For "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on board the train and call up your ticket in "My Tickets".
The trial customers will then see a button for electronic validation.
The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile device saying that passenger X is onboard the train and has occupied booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger there with an already validated online ticket.
So you can carry on sleeping, working, doing nothing.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for customers, and one for the railway – which, in turn, should benefit passengers.
"Anyone who wants to travel in a relaxed fashion, without having his/her ticket inspected by our on-train staff, simply checks in him/herself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their journey time in the train," says Michael Peterson, Director of Marketing at DB Fernverkehr.
A second plus: "And our employees will have more time than they currently do to see to the needs of individual customers".
Anyone who travels by train a lot knows that, alongside delays and missing your train, ticket inspection is one of the biggest annoyances.
For often you yourself, or, in any case, one of your fellow passengers, doesn't have all the documentation on them that one needs to validate an online ticket.
Either the credit card is missing, or the ID card, or some other document that one needs to show.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or wider area and delays in one's own ticket getting checked, and ultimately it takes away the conductor's time to see to other matters.
Only a small number of trial customers can use the new service as of yet.
And only on the connections ICE 915, between Dortmund and Stuttgart, and ICE 912, between Stuttgart and Essen.
Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been enabled.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss the Bit Galerie
The Bit Galerie is moving people although it is still far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into those for and against since its first presentation in 2009.
There is barely anyone left indifferent to the matter.
The topic is also being discussed on our Facebook page, "Volksfreund Bitburg".
Whereas some say of the Bit Galerie, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or, "That would be really fantastic" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side we hear, "No-one needs that" (Siggi Betzen) or, put quite bluntly: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
Whilst those in favour count on the gallery drawing more customers into the town, which would benefit the other businesses as well, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be haemorrhaged.
In addition: The gallery is being planned for exactly the plot where the covered farmers' market is, where 13 direct sellers offer their products.
When construction begins, that will be the end of that.
The Galerie creators want to integrate a covered market into the new building – and, indeed, towards Beda Platz, with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the covered market for years now.
Principally our eggs, but also, always with great pleasure, the delicious cakes of our rural women.
We have also discovered the butcher's for ourselves.
We hope that also while the Galerie is being built, but above all after, there will be the chance to maintain this offering.
That's what they have in other cities too.
The small covered market in Frankfurt, in particular, is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct sellers settle in a covered market in the gallery depends on the level of the rent.
But that is not exactly likely to be low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why a shopping palace in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary.
There are plenty of those in our city already.
One sees, though, how many shop premises stand empty here – some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get to keep the covered market.
For after all, the goods on offer there are fresh, are largely offered directly by the producer, and are good value to boot.
As you see, shop premises in shopping centres are only rented by big companies, because the rents there are often not tenable for retail traders.
Shame – there are hardly any specialist shops left any more and those that are still around will then probably also disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a covered market doesn't match up for me.
And the Galerie doesn't suit Bitburg.
In particular: Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing?
The old Edeka would be the solution – even in the long term, if the Bit Galerie does actually arrive eventually.
Or is the spectre of the Bit Galerie managing even ahead of time to drive all businesses out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It simply will not work.
And a shopping centre that stands empty – no-one needs that either.
In my opinion, it would be better to support a proper farmers' market, instead of this Galerie.
But there is no space left for a covered market thanks to the crazily large number – as I see it – of pointless construction projects in Bitburg
If the covered market is destroyed, then another piece of culture will disappear."
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi is selling no more eggs for the time being
This was announced by the corporate group.
It is a purely precautionary measure, and beyond that, no adverse effects on health can be assumed, said the announcement.
With immediate effect, only eggs that have been proven to test negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lice agent may be delivered to Aldi.
With the move, Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Campaign launched: over 300-year-old Lady Chapel in Rhöndorf encased
By encasing the 301-year-old Lady Chapel in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's Rundschau).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team, led by Nelson Artz, want to keep the logo and slogan a secret still, until Thursday.
At the end of August, as the climax of the campaign, there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too beautiful for us,
are you?" The campaign authors have been asking this, on posters on the Rhöndorf chapel, since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, activated yesterday.
"But we are using this initiative to get your attention.
And to bring home that some things are better than they seem.
In actual fact, we are firmly convinced that we, as residents of Bad Honnef, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our town."
The initiative is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"A stand-alone pledge has to be formulated, one that lends the town an unmistakable unique selling point."
Ultimately, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The town of Bad Honnef has given itself a moderate five-figure amount for the costs of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reform in Turkey – Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August, the highest military council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the general staff building as previously, but rather in the Prime Minister's official residence.
Taking part in the discussions chaired by the head of government were now also the five vice premiers, as well as the ministers for defence, the interior, justice, and foreign affairs.
The civilians were thus in the majority in the YAS.
The government is tightening the reins on the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the marines were removed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt.
As of this week in Ankara, trials are being held against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt at overthrow as a "gift from God", since it gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have control over the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters".
There are concerns among the general staff of an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other ways, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper.
The big clean-up of the army and the security forces is continuing anyway.
In the middle of July, Erdogan fired, by decree, an additional 7395 public servants, among whom were 2303 policeman and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seems as if Erdogan has tamed the military.
Previously, the generals were deemed the true authorities in the country.
Three times they staged a coup, invoking their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After an election victory in 2002, Erdogan has been pushing back the strength of the military bit by bit, not least by invoking the reform guidelines of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully promoting Islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup out of fear of persecution, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, Nato would not be able to be indifferent to such a development.
In any case, after the purges, there is doubt in the alliance concerning the Turkish army's readiness for action.
The governance structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", say Nato diplomats.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Minister wants line renovated for Rennsteig shuttle
In recent months, there have been constant arguments about the future of the Rennsteig shuttle – now it is said to be moving very quickly.
There are plans to build on the dilapidated stretch of track, on which the tourist trains travel, before the end of the year still.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteig shuttle, construction works should begin on the line this year already, according to reports from the Ministry of Transport.
"In taking the decision to continue to commission and to renovate the Ilmnau-Rennsteig line, the state acknowledges that this is an important connection, above all for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the costs for the repairs to the line to be around 2.5 million euros.
The state is taking on 75 per cent of this amount.
The contract, on the basis of which, the shuttle is to be commissioned by the state in the future as well, is currently being finalised, explained Sühl.
The ministry and Süd-Thüringen Bahn, as operators, are said to already be in agreement over the technical details.
"The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the train company is being concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle should therefore be commissioned as normal from December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, beloved above all by tourists.
In past months, as part of a pilot operation, there were tests to see whether the line gets used by a large enough number of people for it to continue to be commissioned as normal in the future.
The line is very run-down in places.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold found a curious egg
As the last amongst the schools in Blumberg, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were let go for the holidays and sent forth for secondary schools.
Three of the graduating students will be going to the Gymnasium secondary school, and four to the Realschule.
School headteacher Angelika Sitte greeted parents and public representatives in the Biesental community centre in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol for the school graduation, the 29 students from the fourth grade, under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose an eagle that is growing up in the chicken yard, but will be then released into the wild.
Added to this, the lively bunch performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the Chicken Yard."
Farmer Arnold found a curious egg and had his chickens hatch it.
Instead of a chick, a small eagle emerged.
Yet hopes of making a chicken out of it were dashed; the eagle spread its wings out on a high mountain and vanished.
Afterwards, grades three and four performed a chicken dance, staged by Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced in competition with the young roosters, who were wearing top hats.
The eagle stands for integration, said headteacher Angelika Sitte.
The young animals may well be different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs amongst them.
Though it will never be like a chicken.
It is its destiny to be free.
She wished for every fourth grader that he/she would feel accepted in his/her new school.
There followed a word of thanks to her colleagues, the former headteacher Michael Müller, who is always filling in when there are teacher shortages, and the parent representatives.
The time as chicks is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She releases her students only very reluctantly, after two years of teaching, for it has been a really fantastic time.
In the end, she was able to depend on the fourth graders.
To close, all the students raised a song, with Summertime and Holiday Time.
That brought out a lot of joy from the children.
There are already eight first graders registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know
How exactly is the software update taking place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the initiative?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total.
They are intended to improve exhaust emission properties for cars classed under Euro emissions standard 5, and, some under Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment:
Is the new initiative compulsory?
No, the brokered software updates are voluntary.
"The compulsory updates prior to this apply only to vehicles that have emissions test scamming software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered that they be retrofitted.
How and from when are customers being notified of updates?
The manufacturers have announced that there will be swift implementation in the coming months, but have not specified any precise deadline yet.
Daimler has advised those affected to write to them.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be settled during the course of that.
How long are the retrofittings likely to drag on for altogether?
"Difficult to say," says Smetatnin.
It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.
"For we have seen that thus far, car manufacturers have not been acting of their own accord when it comes to matters of the environment."
How long should the update last?
The retrofitting itself could last only three to four hours in the garage.
It could be more laborious getting an appointment.
What do car drivers do who don't drive a car by BMW, Daimler, Opel or the VW Group?
The ACE advises waiting.
Foreign manufacturers would apparently follow suit, said Smetanin.
Is there now the threat of a massive price collapse in Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in those regions where there are threats of driving bans.
In rural areas, there have as yet been no drops in value for older diesel cars.
The ACE advises still waiting before selling.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center honours
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first honours ceremony under President Trump promises to get political.
One of the award winners does not want to come – out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, singers Gloria Estefan (59) and Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among those being honoured.
The awards are handed over at the beginning of December.
As is tradition, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and will take part in the presentation of awards, together with his wife Melania.
For this reason, the award-winner Lear, made famous by a series of TV shows, already announced that he would not be attending the gala.
He said to the "New York Times": "This presidency has decided to completely turn its back on the arts and human rights – even take funding away from them – and that upsets me."
The 59-year old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the biggest cultural establishment in the US capital.
Former prizewinners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We're making the city liveable
Roland Wacker, municipal architect in Haslach, is going into retirement next year.
The post has already been advertised – suitable applicants, though, are few and far between.
Wacker has been municipal architect for 31 years.
And he still finds the work a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press meeting.
He reports of varied, but also demanding, tasks that await his successors.
At the same time, it surprises him that up until now no application has satisfied the job profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible opportunity.
This should then allow enough time for induction training – observing usual notice periods.
As Haslach serves as the lower board of building regulations for the joint association of administrations, applicants have to hold appropriate qualifications.
For the town wants to maintain this role at all costs.
If it could no longer fulfil it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But accessibility for citizens is important to the town and to him too, says Wacker, who reports of a good working atmosphere and a cheerful mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has amassed several significant projects that he looks back on with pride.
"We're making the city liveable," is something he is certain of, re: the building authorities and his colleagues.
But in the future too, there are diverse projects on the agenda: the redesign of a former Hukla plot and of the Niederhofen carpark, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and refurbishment of the stadium is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost as much as 1.5 million euros "if we do it properly", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, there are great tasks awaiting my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of scope for creativity for a municipal architect.
With Haslach's own building yard and garden nursery, there is a lot that can be responded too with a high level of flexibility.
"One can affect a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as a whole has protected building status, it is important "to have an eye for what fits in" if new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing municipal architect.
In any case, the municipal architect bears a lot of responsibility.
He is master of construction: "In the end, everything here passes by my desk".
For support and coordination, he can count on years-old colleagues: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been there ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering), already 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay".
For continuity is important not only for a good working atmosphere, but also for the future design of the city.
Anyone who wishes to take over from Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate completed studies as graduate engineer or a bachelors degree with a specialisation in architecture and should have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning laws.
The municipal planning and building control office is in charge of building construction and civil engineering, urban land-use planning, land acquisition affairs, management of municipal property, the municipal depot with building yard and city nursery, and the lower board of building regulations, including preservation of sites of historic interest.
Bicycle thrown onto cables: southern railway closed
According to police, the as-of-yet unknown perpetrator had thrown the blue bicycle onto the cables from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116).
These were so badly damaged in the course of this that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are proceeding on the assumption that there were two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since last night.
A pink scooter and bicyclist were observed near to the scene of the incident by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a roguish prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators put themselves and the rail traffic in great danger.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and facilities, as well as the time in delays and the costs for the rail replacement services, the perpetrators could also be faced with railway customers' penalty fees.
Altogether, one can expect a "considerable" sum, said the spokesman.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and the rail traffic on the southern railway stretch was able to be operated without obstructions.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday afternoon, two of them were long-distance trains.
Freight trains were not cancelled, although they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aeroplane manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots departed from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the outline began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and drew the shape of a Dreamliner over the USA – that's thousands of kilometres.
The campaign lasted 18 hours and one minute.
The shape of a Dreamliner could be seen on radar screens.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing hat already carried out such a promotion before.
The number "787" was painted in the sky, along with the Boeing logo.
New low blow for Martin Schulz – Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind changes: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked, with a certain alarm, to Berlin before elections.
No disturbances from party headquarters, no opposing winds from the state – that was the campaigners' biggest wish.
Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt house have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, you couldn't even begin to describe as an opposing wind.
Those were low blows.
And one after the other at that.
After the surprising end to the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general sign of a move away from coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This once again shows that Red-Green simply can't govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green representative plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a stark crisis.
Five months ahead of the state elections, his red-green coalition thus lost their one-vote majority over the opposition made up of CDU and FDP.
The national head of the Greens, Michael Kellner, has called on defecting Green representative in Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to give up her seat.
The cross-over to the CDU represents a clear distortion of the voters' will.
Elke Twesten must immediately give up her seat", said national head and campaign leader for the Greens to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"It just can't be true," sighed an SPD campaigner, when the bad news reached party headquarters on Friday afternoon.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is left without a governing majority after the cross-over of Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the present crisis in a long line of big and small disasters in SPD state associations.
And no-one knows what is coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly decisive defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, no more, his comrades contented themselves at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything was going to be different.
And it was too – in fact, everything was significantly worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tailspin, and the Düsseldorf washout bowled the party clean over.
Their peers then picked themselves up again in the weeks afterwards, with some effort.
Then, just as they had regained new faith, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with that came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD regional leader, lost his halo that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic hall while his city was burning.
And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And now Stephan Weil too.
Thanks to the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been facing criticism for some time.
Lousy poll results added to that.
Despite that, or perhaps precisely because of that, Weil has been attempting ever more strongly in the last few weeks to make a mark in the federal government.
The former mayor of Hanover's attempts to build up his power in Berlin have not gone unnoticed by peers in Martin Schulz's entourage.
They used to let him do as he liked, since they expected Weil to be a stabilising force for the party.
Now, just the opposite may happen.
In actual fact, Weil is not to blame for the Lower Saxony Greens' party-internal strife.
And Schulz is certainly not.
For the time being, therefore, their peers are taking pains to keep their ranks closed.
Their anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all, at the defecting parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unacceptable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten was voted into parliament not for her person, as a direct candidate, but on a Lower Saxony Green Party ticket, continued the Lower Saxony member of parliament.
The logical conclusion would be for her to give up her seat.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplored the "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," said Oppermann, who as frontrunner is leading the Lower Saxony SPD into the Bundestag elections, to the RND.
"Now the personal career notions of a future CDU representative is distorting the electoral result," continued Oppermann.
He called for light to be shed on the circumstances surrounding the matter.
I want to know whether there was anything more there, or if additional commitments were made to the Lower Saxony CDU.
Grant money for Town Centre III
Anyone who wants to renovate their outdated house will soon be able to get support from the state.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives for STEG urban development provided information about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once more cast a glimpse back to what has been the case so far.
Since 1991, there have been regeneration areas in Empfingen.
Back then, in regeneration area I, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden Württemberg still took on two thirds of the grant amount.
From 2005 to 2016, in regeneration area II, the subsidy still lay at 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the refurbishments up until this point have been a "successful project" – it is ultimately important to support interior development too, and not only develop new construction areas.
On 4th April, word was received from Karlsruhe regional council that there will be a regeneration area III.
The grant amount is 833,333 euros, of which, 500,000 euros is to come from the federal state, the rest, from the municipality of Emfingen.
How does a regeneration area come about?
One will investigate, explains Schindler further, where the "truly old" houses are.
What also comes into play, however, is whether there is even any interest to renovate in the planned area at all.
If necessary, the area boundaries can also then be shifted again.
STEG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the content of the government and federal state "Soziale Stadt" programme, within whose scope the refurbishments would then be implemented.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of town centres, the improvement of living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented on a property-specific, that is, per-premises, basis.
The regeneration area would then ultimately be laid down as statute.
The appropriation period for the subsidies has been running from 1st January 2017 and will continue to do so until 30th April 2026.
First, however, stocktaking will be carried out until September of this year, as part of which, those with a stake in the regeneration area will receive a survey to fill out.
The resolution should preferably follow in November or December, so that refurbishments can be begun next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that every community must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies.
It's about assessing the shortcomings in the urban design and deciding what will be renovated and to what extent.
A renovation comment will then be recorded in the land registry for each premises.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again himself and get an idea of the location, he promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of those involved is an essential factor for the project's success.
That is why there will be surveys, which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow survey is the "building and property survey", which is about, among other things, the structural condition and the intentions for refurbishment.
In the grey survey, the "budget and housing survey", information can be provided on the size, breakdown and residents of a living space.
The blue "business survey" is only filled out if business premises operate in the building.
It should be noted, however, Gotzel pointed out, that a filled-out survey is not at the same time an application for grant money.
What is more, new building initiatives are not eligible for funding.
Schindler also stressed that funding would be allocated on a "first-come, first-served" basis – the early bird gets the worm.
It is not possible to "reserve" grant money for later.
To conclude, photos of the "Town Centre II" project were shown, to "sell" the idea of refurbishment to those present.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss faces tricky task
Front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is competing at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV.
TC Blau-Weiss Neuss is competing tomorrow in Kiel, from 11am, at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite still flawless results after five matches, the front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is maintaining a sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent at any rate.
"This is a compact team that always plays in very similar formation.
In the back positions, in particular, I find the team very good."
It is above all the imports from the high north that bring class and stability to Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to Davis Cup appearances.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen, and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It will be difficult for us, as always.
You need a good dose of luck as well."
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practically set.
Maxime Janvier could give his debut for Blau-Weiß.
If the Frenchman, currently still active in the challenger tournament in Italian Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, then Zdenek Kolar (Czech), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will be called into action for the first time this season.
The as yet undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still hitting balls with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.
He should also be there in Kiel though, just like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the Club an der Alster, Máté Valkusz could also move back into the team.
If that's not enough for the 18-year-old from Hungary, who in January 2016 was still number one in the junior world rankings, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill out the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump didn't exactly look happy on Wednesday evening as he placed his signature under a bill that would see sanctions against Russia strengthened.
"In its haste to pass this legislation", Congress packed in some "unconstitutional provisions," he griped.
The reaction from Moscow, too, was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels seethed at the US motion.
After all, the bill plans to penalise European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Ever since, investors in Austria's OMV, which together with other European companies has co-financed the construction of Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been accordingdly perturbed.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early to gauge the consequences, according to the official statement from the Oil group.
In reality, Donald Trump would still have to put the sanctions into being himself through an executive order.
He has twelve weapons to choose from here.
"The press" has set out to see what the group could fight off and what could really do it harm.
Narcos season 3 trailer: With Pablo Escobar gone, the Cali Cartel take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite season two of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the former receiving its first trailer, teasing the show's upcoming villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned their attention towards the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" just with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) being the brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) running the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) based in New York.
The newly released trailer sees Pedro Pascal return as Javier Peña, the character enlisting American and Colombian law enforcement to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
Season three of Narcos will debut 1 September.
Roll back in time: the city employs 46 kitchen assistants
The city is once more organising the nursery lunch itself.
With designated contact persons for the children and place in the team.
The clock is being turned back in the city's nurseries.
On the 1st September, the city of Krefeld is once more taking the catering in the city's nurseries (Kitas) into its own hands.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare services department, this is good news: "We were all delighted".
The cooking is still done off premises: a caterer takes care of this task and delivers freshly cooked, chilled food.
The city operates 46 nurseries in the district of Krefeld; in 44 of these, the children get a warm meal at midday.
In the last nursery year, 2800 children sat at the tables in each case, and demand is growing steadily.
"By now, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week that eat in the Kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz.
"The service is also available for the 35-hour care option, when children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time staff are on kitchen duty on 1st September: they warm up the delivered meals, supplement them with salad, crudités and fruit, put the meals into individual portions, hand out the food, clear up, wash up and clean the kitchen.
"The workers are assigned to a fixed Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size – there are two-group and seven-group establishments – dictates the number of hours worked.
"The kitchen assistants now firmly belong in the Kita team," says Pommeranz contentedly.
"That way they are much more closely involved, and it is easier for the nursery head to put educational concepts in place."
Because it's about this too: a healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
Directly linking the kitchen staff to the team makes sense then.
For the children too.
"They have a known staff member in the Kita, someone who is familiar to them, and not people who are continuously changing."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms – up until now also a task for the kitchen staff – will in future be taken care of by special cleaning personnel.
This option – the separation of cleaning and the kitchen service – not only improves the quality of the kitchen's output, but also has the appeal of having turned out to be the most economical option for the city when comparing costs between in-house and outsourcing, said the press office.
And that is despite 46 new part-time staff being employed.
"But these hours don't have nearly so much impact for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections take place April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.

Men attempt to mug 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from police, the men approached the 13-year-old girl, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, at around 2.55pm, because they wanted to use the girl's mobile to make a phone call.
The 13-year-old refused their request and carried on walking with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then attempted to snatch the mobile and the girl's necklace, but was unsuccessful.
The duo then fled without their loot.
Both young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are underway.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
Scooter knocked over and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in the Königsfelder Straße outside residence number 30, thus causing material damage of over 200 euros to the fairing of the vehicle.
Schramberg police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, are appealing for leads.
Police are seeking witnesses in relation to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese
Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and grazed the crash barrier.
On Thursday evening, at around 7.55pm, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was en route in his VW on the B215 coming from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the region of the Stolzenau bypass, a passenger car came towards him in his lane, so he had to swerve to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver grazed the crash barrier.
The car suffered material damage.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without concerning himself with the traffic accident.
According to information provided by the victim of the accident, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now appealing for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident to get in touch with Stolzenau Police Station via the telephone number 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is still causing debate.
After its publication, Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the German press agency that he was expecting an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedikt XVI.
It would be of great service to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret over their own failures or their false assessments of events back then.
The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the coverage was measuring violence at the Domspatzen using "double standards".
With respect to the assaults in Regensburg, no-one doubts that these were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in future; however, what was striking was the "level of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is now a part of our everyday experience and sets up public opinion for considering that as normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio that "people love to let loose on the Church, and it is an easy target".
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a totally normal educational tool for dealing with cheeky children, of which I was one."
She thought it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger cropped up a lot.
Absolutely unfair, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who together with Ratzinger compiled the commemorative volume "My Brother, the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, for in his assessment, the result of the final report "has nothing to do with him".
What exactly is in the 440-page report that lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg, has produced?
In total, 547 members of the Regensburger Domspatzen were "highly likely" the victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report said of Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, that "in summary, it can be determined that forms of corporal and physical violence were used by the cathedral's Master of Music R. in many cases".
When he was highly emotional, in particular, the punishment for the students could be a lot more severe.
Despite this, it is apparent that, in contrast to numerous others of the accused, many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."
Hesemann explains in the interview why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger.
For Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of violence against wards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" paints a contradictory picture of the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students stress his "humaneness".
On the other hand, he also comes across as a choleric type and perfectionist, who would often turn to violence if one of the Domspatzen didn't give a top musical performance.
How do you judge this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If one makes the effort and reads the entire 440-page-long report from start to finish, one actually has to ask what the name of Georg Ratzinger is doing in there at all.
Eight pages are devoted to him, all in one go, and he is clearly exculpated from every suspicion of complicity or connivance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The extreme acts of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of activity.
At best, one can accuse him of having found out too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzen secondary school, where he was active, was perceived by practically all of those asked as – to quote – "salvation", "heaven" and a "better world".
So, the vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger a quite glowing testimonial, describing him as "warm-hearted", "beloved", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provide the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always mobbed by clusters of children".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which from time to time also led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that during the course of this he not only banged chairs and threw his bunch of keys to the floor, but even handed out slaps around the face and pulled on the hair or ears of all-too-impudent boys is something that he himself already admitted years ago, that he deeply regrets and apologises for.
In his defence, however, it must also be said that such methods of education in that questionable period between the 1960s and 1970s were wide-spread amongst parents as well as teachers.
Do you remember such castigation methods?
I'm thinking of those of us who were born before 1968, of course.
I too experienced that, in a secular school, too, a state Gymnasium.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely, appalling sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence at preschool, these are of course mere trifles.
So one cannot help but ask whether the fact that lots of media are bearing down on him in particular does not have more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVI.
Indeed, lots of people are still slaving away assiduously on the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him.
But the truth is: the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, there was a lot reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also being accused in the final report of some kind of involvement or complicity in respect of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly not.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have confided in the cathedral's Master of Music.
Not once were the parents brought in the loop.
"I never dared talk about it with my father or my mother," said one of those affected, as a representative for the others, "It was always very embarrassing for me".
But the real problem when it comes to throwing light on sexual abuse was and is that the majority of victims stay silent out of shame.
If they don't even confide in parents and siblings, then they for sure are not going to to a choir leader, who after all had been a professional colleague, as it were, of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen schoolboys judge Ratzinger's role in respect of the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: One pupil asked put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) had had early enough knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators in question.
I also think... it is quite absurd to assume that... boys opened up more emphatically or clearly or even sooner to him, of all people, than to their parents, the heads of their boarding houses, mentors etc.
That one would speak with him about sex... – unthinkable."
So, the report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "That affected pupils and/or those around them confided in him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has therefore been absolved of any complicity.
Therefore, he can also not be accused of not having stopped it or reported it.
There is therefore also no reason to bring his good name into association with this despicable crime, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, one read a lot about "extreme acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report of "turning a blind eye".
Does he have to live with this accusation then?
Michael Hesemann: That is indeed the big problem, that in the coverage, everything was mixed up and confounded into a huge melange of sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence and somewhere, in the middle of that, was Georg Ratzinger.
But precisely that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
That is to say, there is a clean separation there: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as, shall we say, other accusations.
What is more, the report handles cases from the period since 1945, that is, from four decades, as well, when Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole hideous educational theory of spanking, the cases where boys were downright bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers, and from which they suffered terribly, all of these took place in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
Yet the cathedral's Master of Music Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with these, for he first set eyes on the boys when they were already at the Domspatzen secondary school.
There, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the topic of the "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have got away from it and enjoyed the much better treatment and the conditions that were even "paradisiacal" for many.
What was different at the Domspatzen secondary school then?
Michael Hesemann: Discipline still ruled there, sure, but there was no sadistic violence.
And that applies to Georg Ratzinger likewise, in relation to whom the report concludes that "many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."
So, at best, there remains the accusation of having turned a blind eye.
Yet despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was given reports about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the practices in a school where he did not even work and for which he was not responsible (according to the witness), and then next only in around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger systematically close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen secondary school, which was even reproduced in the report.
In that, he pointed this out, "that in the preschool corporal punishment is still practised."
Even when facing the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention.
That was naturally at a time when there was legal clarity that corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria too.
Before that, it was taking place in a legal grey zone, as every one of us well knows.
So it was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerating or dramatising and where the permissible limits had really been overstepped.
But one cannot say that he always turned a blind eye.
That is simply not true.
It was first in 1980 that corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis indeed asserts that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to that earlier time.
What is your opinion on this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk here about "the pitfall of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The Princess is quite right here.
But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was despicable at all times, and also not to that which was perpetrated in the preschool in terms of vile acts and violence against innocent children; that of course goes far beyond what was accepted back then.
That is all absolutely terrible and I am glad that it is finally being looked into.
But at the same time I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger, for all that has nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, slapping around the face and pulling the hair and ears, was widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he complied strictly with that too.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reflect then in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother, the Pope"?
Did the subject of corporal punishment ever come up?
Michael Hesemann: Look, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedikt XVI., told from his perspective, so the Domspatzen played only a subsidiary role.
Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he ran a strict regime there.
But this too has to be said: without this perfectionism, without this demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to forge from the Regensburger Domspatzen – up until that point famous rather on a national level – a world-class institution, a cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, that twice a-piece went on tour to the USA (1983 and 1987) and to Japan (1988 and 1991).
Not with biscuits and sweets alone does one all at once turn insubordinate boys into great singers, and face every success, regardless of the area, but rather, with continuous discipline, passion and self-conquest.
What kind of impression did you get of Georg Ratzinger the man then in those conversations for your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond that, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really very well, and my experience of him was always as a wonderful, humorous, totally benevolent, deeply devout and good-hearted man, who one cannot imagine would be capable of even hurting a fly.
I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still today keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him – he is almost blind – and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who up until today still do not forgive him for once being too strict with them are therefore in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them nearer to the world of music.
And for always being a good, fatherly teacher – a strict father, sure, that may well be – but also a loving person, to be respected, whom they still look up to today and downright worship.
And please, once more, just to be clear: all that he is accused of are methods of education, that back then were order of the day.
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.
But it is highly unjust to make a media scapegoat out of a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind that is all too obvious.
For the report that was just published exonerates him.
Now one would ask for the decency to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has rendered great service and without whom probably no-one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know of the Regensburger Domspatzen

In the afternoon there is another surprise waiting for our contestants: they will be competing for the romantic candlelight photo shoot at MY SOLARIS not alone, but together with a male-model Fabian!
Hvar with its flirting, coquetting, and seduction is not an easy task for our girls.

Despite dealing with wind, sprays and rain, the nine contestants of "The Beauty of Munich" behaved like real professionals at the photo shoot with People-photographer Tuan.
You may watch the romantic photoshoot on the video:
The president of DFB Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Özil
Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Mesut Özil to the national team.
There is an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of the debate going on for months about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-match national player Özil.
I would be happy if Mesut Özil continued to play for Germany.
At some point of time I also assumed that it will happen, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and that he is not ready for a discussion with national coach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows that in football ‘if you leave a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that this discussion did not happen before’.
Linz: Garden shed in allotment gardens burnt down
At 14.13 the Linz professional fire department was notified of a fire in Angererhofweg.
As a high-voltage power line directly traverses the allotment garden, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade drove out and on arrival found the hut fully in flames.
The roof had to be almost completely removed and the huge amount of debris needed clearing.
The owner of the burning garden hut stated that at noon he had connected a battery to the power supply for charging.
This was the possible cause of the fire.
According to the fire department the loading unit was in the most intensive area of the fire.
The damage caused by the fire, and the cause of the fire, still needs to be investigated.
The damage could be considerable as the owner stored many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions?
She apparently wanted to lure the children away from the alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, ‘Herbie: Fully Loaded’) has live streamed how she openly wanted to tear children away from a family in Moscow.
This was reported by US portal "TMZ" with publication of a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see the "Just My Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes up to a possibly homeless family, identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flee in front of the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
Yet she does not offer any proof in the clip.
The whole world is watching, says Lohan in the video as she follows the family further down the street.
She seems to try to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother had it enough.
It looks as if they turn around and Lohan gets a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress protests about how shocked she is - holding her cheek.
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: These are "Mascot's" tasks on the asteroid
The “Hayabusa2” probe launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It should get so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it back to Earth.
The lander “Mascot” will remain on Ryugu.
International news ticker: Number of dead in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are reports of at least 420 casualties.
Reportedly, the number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet progressed into the ravaged and isolated areas.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman
In the beginning, there was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused nervousness on the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal by the electric car manufacturer.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the parties have now agreed to a settlement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss steps down as chairman, but he may remain as CEO.
The British Conservative Party Conference
Under tight security - the Tory party conference
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference was to address foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference was overshadowed by the conflict between Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, with ex-Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson in the frontline.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have reached agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about the duplicate name for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
In future, the state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia and the population will vote on this measure on Sunday from the population - will it turn out okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
Ele Nao ("Not him") - addressed to Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil and the mood in the country is divided.
In many cities thousands are taking to the street to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The ‘Brazilian Trump’ is presenting himself as an anti-system candidate and is ahead in the polls.
His keenest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the left workers’ party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes longer than planned
There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘Automobilwoche’ trade journal.
In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, the taskforce will be dissolved soon.
In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked out.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery at Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘serious, organizational changes’, to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue this discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission values.
He must have known about the tampering or deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘Heilbronner Stimme’.
Essentially, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
The segment in itself is a difficult one, he said.
Schot is for electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric automobile.
Grindel seeking re-election - Lahm to join the Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF’s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do.
And then you have to see what kind of support you get.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB’s national conference on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Presidential Board.
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting matters, said Grindel.
At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her family back to Cameroon.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says, ‘the issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, ‘this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.
Losing weight the right way with semi-smart scales
I have owned a new toy for four weeks now.
Scales that weigh my body fat percentage as well as my weight.
Even muscle and bone mass can be displayed.
This thing also calculates my body mass index but that is rather useless anyway.
After all, it does not tell me whether I have been replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new German Basketball League season with a sound victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112-55 (52-31) over 40 minutes in a very exciting game.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominating Berlin team with 20 points.
The international Johannes Thiemann from Ludwigsburg (18 points) also showed off his performance in front of 9113 spectators at his competitive debut.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won coach Ainars Bagatskis’ competitive debut with 84-80 (39-37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer of the visitors with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate thrower with 24 points in coach John Patrick’s team .
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season successfully.
Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear victory with 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburg team with 25 points.
The Braunschweig team, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the season started, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run tells it all.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to unsettle our citizens and damage the German/Turkish friendship’, he said.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Many thousands of police were deployed, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic association is under criticism because it is seen as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and scary moments
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and illness at a collective concert in New York’s Central Park.
Get involved wherever you can, said Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with tassels and a gold microphone.
I am nervous, I am sweating, but it’s OK because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Even actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, government representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lasted for hours.
There was a scary moment when many spectators mistook the noise of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to run away.
There was a short panic with people running in all directions.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the audience from the stage.
Nobody is trying to injure anyone, said Martin.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge online.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases online.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
Flake did join his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage in calling for more equal rights between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate supporting the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, which offended many women.
At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects these.
Flake called for an FBI investigation after two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
You are welcome to join me in an elevator anytime, Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of Press: Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German writing “Freedom for journalists” and was sitting in the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a lot of unrest, which was unacceptable.
Thus, he ordered bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the federal chancellery.
no matter if it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for the failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in jail.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the incarcerated journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but the legal processes in Turkey against the two are still ongoing.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, though: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “Schellfischposten.”
Moderator Ina Müller often cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood and their tongues.
Quite a few celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip didn’t do the actor any good, though.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.
The bed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has quite a hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink "die schwarze Sau".
And Spritz.
And also pass on Ina’s round of eggnog at half past two."
The long night is really showing on the 43-year-olds’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tips for getting rid of a hangover.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - painkillers.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
We still don't know how Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at night.
Since she has hosted the wild TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much better prepared...
Out for a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered.
Attempts are made to remedy the rampant vandalism, but there are hardly any signs of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
There is no solution so far.
Suggestions ranged from transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I think, the latter would be the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory council.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.
It is not just about the noise, there are also disturbances due to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
If it suffers the same fate, it will cost dearly.
Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to come out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequented.
It is still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German’, agreed the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the culture train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to participate in the music contest was a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the motto of the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Contest for young and old, new and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink from the lovely Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, from a one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This contest is a novelty, explains district mayor Joachim Schmidt.
We have not seen something like this in other districts.
What did the songwriters sing about?
Particularly popular places were the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song to the avenue Marktalle in his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.
Over and over again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the artists.
Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
And Alvin Jasic has uploaded a lot of YouTube videos.
It’s not about winning, Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup catering businesses.
For the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
They considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"
The players form two teams and sit opposite one another.
For each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil.
This ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.
For example, on the cards it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Fenster.
3. Cube.
4. Solidʺ.
These are the terms that need to be coded.
So the terms are not guessed, the codes are.
Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.
They get a code card that has "3.4.2." etc. written on it.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret film that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The task in this case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "solid" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins the game.
The encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read some history books and knows about the defenestration of Prague.
This then progresses, round for round, team by team.
It is true that one does not know the terms of the other side - but with every clue the encryptor gives, you’re closer to finding them out.
So the term should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy. Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic ‘Decrypto’ is the precept unfortunately.
The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the web will make it easier.
But once you have started, you’ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few words, but it’s much easier to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man gives police the Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kulmbach twice something to do.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the upper town, later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he harassed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply with the police order to vacate the premises, he had to spend the night in the detention cell in the police station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to take legal responsibility for the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an end to a piece of railway history.
The crashing from bumper to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did not bother anybody.
The squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel’s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for the steep mountain section to the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of about 220 meters.
Previously trains and locomotives housed in Pressig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroad maintenance division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of experience.
The Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomotives.
From 1977 they were still used with freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the remainder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘It’s a shame that better use of the location is not envisaged, also with regard to freight traffic’.
Still in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dinkel.
Shortly afterwards.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
The shunters and wheel scotches took care of the heaviest rail traffic work, remembers Dinkel.
Each mistake could have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and current pictures there are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with initial success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges before.
Kerber won 6:2 at the China Open against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Daria Kassatkina, when the Russian athlete on rank 13 gave up.
The Swabian will now face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
On the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which took place in the open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt property in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) in the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors for the 15th year.
The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibits.
21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
The host Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the exhibition.
He had been there from the first hour.
As has Volker Hahn, who has made a name for himself as the main organiser as well as an artist.
It was a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement some days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in experienced, young hands with excellent future prospects.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing flyers.
Once again this year there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (art and enjoyment), available at every art station.
The poster this year ‘outdance the Betzn’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception of the special exhibit.
It was possible to persuade Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provide musical framing.
The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
There are metal or ceramic works of art, often accented with color.
Already at the entrance to the property, on the right side, the visitor is awaited by the "Glücksbaum" (luck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened with color, equipped with 20 pin wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes for a sound piece.
The sun shining through the bushes in the background adds a magical touch to the object, inviting visitors to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to dedicate three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heavenly Child).
At the end, Volker Hahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from clay, cement and stainless steel.
The ‘wind chime performance’ theme wanders through the multi-purpose art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31, 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - That was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.
At least five of them.
In no case did they want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend by now: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came to existence.
That was 50 years ago.
Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in the “House of Encounter.”
It will be full today, senses chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
There are 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break for the first time.
The traditional festival was back again in time for the 50th anniversary.
It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested beforehand.
Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “House of Encounter,” but rather sat comfortably around tables.
In between, everyone could dance. DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and heated up the dance floor.
Of course, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten would let their voices sound.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were quite fitting.
Almost set: "So ein Tag, so wunderschön wie heute."
There was also the “Rüdesheim wine” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which many guests had in front of them.
“Humulus lupulus,” which is the Latin name for ‘hops,’ references another cool drink.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was once again very confident.
It's just fun to sing under his direction, said Holstiege. "He has such an easy way, he accomplishes a masterpiece every time.". By the way, this time not only men were presented vocally.
The ladies’ choir “High C” were also guests, whose repertoire above all includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
To round it all off there was some poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodic poetry.
There was also a big Tombola game.
The proceeds are to go towards financing the children of the Albatros Youth Center visiting the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing their thing.
And with the 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals BW Aasee, they did really well.
It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed with him: “This is a defeat that we can live with.
We are not dissatisfied.” Quite the contrary.
In the evening, at Ronja de Boer’s belated birthday party, the mood was good, the game was done.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
If you bring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows from years of experience.
Ultimately USC made everything clear with its experienced players and finished it out.
We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.
That was not our undoing.
I've seen a great game of volleyball at times, Annacker did not struggle with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.
After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents’ journey goes.
It’s simply too early for that, says Axel Büring.
He only feels vindicated in one thing: “The 3rd Women's League has an unbelievably good level of play.
It’s not even close with regional league volleyball.” They don't even want to look down towards the fourth league.
If they don’t want to lose hope, they have to look up.
But a conclusion can't be drawn until after ten or eleven games.
The next game is at Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will compete in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for her husband
The "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) became famous in her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘Dream Boat’, but on 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten years.
This could also have been a reason.
Because this work became a part of me, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
She used to be "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dream Ship".
Because now journalists called her only as Heide Keller.
I don’t know if he was happy with this.
She thinks that it possible that her husband might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to discover my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I’m pretending," as she explains further.
She always had the feeling of ‘not being enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which actually I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever’.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘Yes’ again, ‘although I was scared it could go wrong again’.
The day before the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as well.
Why did it never work out with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller was in love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not compatible with daily life.
I am too naive to approach love."
The moth, who regularly explores the city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, has now attempted this on the ZFF opening party.
Not really a moth, just a little shady.
And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is the film festival though, where the more or less famous want to bathe in the spotlight.
So this late Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, whatever the reason, it literally stinks in the gents area.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film "Green Book", like every year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown originate from the whole globe.
What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass inside.
Inside, the invited are crowded together, they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the highlight is: that the shop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event.
It has been like this for years and seems to function without any major losses.
You must just love the country for it!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the escalator if you are wearing a long dress".
Should this be two separate instructions, he has ignored the dress code.
However, it is a conditional construction that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival award.
The mixture getting the prize for the best drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the brand mentioned for years, is also not there on the evening.
There is one face, however, between local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that is familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.
Its main character will not be far away.
And in reality: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty walks through the crowd appearing almost like a choir boy.
He is not talked into, not gaped at, at the most he receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why the international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with a Cumbia dance
Trainer and ex-footballer, Diego Maradona is delighted at his team’s victory.
Argentina’s football legend, Diego Maradona has clearly settled well in his new homeland Mexico.
The 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the changing room to Cumbia rhythms after a 2:0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, as shown in a video already released on Saturday.
A team member’s 15-second clip shows Maradona dancing in a yellow strip, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second league team defeated Leones Negros 2:0.
After the game Maradona said to a TV camera ‘Time after time with my boys’.
Since the beginning of September the 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute loss
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat.” His protégés were “devastated” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
Over long periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.
We only overslept the initial phase, said the ASV coach annoyed.
Quickly, the home team led with 8-1, also the early break, that Bieletzki had taken, did not pan out.
But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki.
At halftime, they were only two goals behind.
Senden's best player, Marius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.
After the change, things got even better from the visitors’ point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15-15.
Four minutes before the alarm, the lead was still only three goals (29-26).
And then?
The impartial got in on the action.
Bieletzki usually does not seek blame with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty caused by Steffen Mühlhoff “was a joke.”
LIT had an opportunity and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, defended well and repeatedly threw the ball on the empty goal.
But compliments don’t win games.
Now it must be a damned victory, said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a (then) 18 year old Naila (district of Hof), police are searching for the remains of the woman.
Response services dug up a street on Saturday near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed below, as police and prosecutors announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former home.
The woman disappeared on November 4, 1986.
Investigators at the time did not rule out foul play.
According to information, since last year the criminal investigation department of Hof has been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecution department.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road in Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials were able to limit the area to a few yaars.
The results of the excavations are to be announced this afternoon.
The hacking attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers that lurk online.
Users themselves can also take care of additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their online accounts.
In addition, security updates, such as those for Windows, should be quickly installed and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatened dismissal as the chief executive of the billion dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled a lawsuit out of court regarding misleading Tweets in which Musk could have lost his ability to manage listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla are each paying 20 million US dollars. In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years.
He may stay CEO, though.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC has sued the world-famous manager in the US federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the electric car pioneer currently posting losses, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk unaware of any wrongdoing
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and is very sad and disappointed about the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth and transparency and with his investors in mind.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he would maybe remove the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 US dollars per share. The financing was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at 72 billion dollars.
Musk later backpedaled: Tesla remains a listed company.
According to the agreement, Tesla now has to find external chairman, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Shortly before closing Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a curler into the corner.
Record champion Manchester United is sliding deeper into crisis following the worst season start since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho earned a justified lost at West Ham United 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven matchdays only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against Valencia on Tuesday.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after Petr Cech was injured.

Survey: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of recent weeks, the grand coalition conceded several poll low blows.
A survey indicates that the SPD falls behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is reviewed critically.
Berlin - For the first time the AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the polling institute, the AfD has gained one point and holds 17 percent, the SPD, compared to the previous week, has lost a point and holds 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a point and hold only 27 percent.
So far this is the lowest rating for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens achieve 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday were the Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes according to Emnid.
The large coalition for all the large research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, lost the majority in the ‘Sunday question’.
The government parties are coming up with 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 general election, together they received 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth is also great for the other parties: The AfD, in many polls holds the position of second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens receive vote quotas of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The Left have an average of 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
Such surveys have an uncertainty of plus/minus 2 to 3 percent, according to statistical reasons, depending on the share of votes.
Since the 2017 general election however the backing for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly in the population.
Currently only 48 percent of citizens believe Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as is revealed in the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
Only one in two (50 percent) in the survey want a grand coalition by the next regular parliamentary election in three years, 41 percent want a re-election.
Even in another survey published on Saturday clear losses in approval for Merkel were noted.
Divided was also the assessment of Germans concerning whether in December Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
In the case of the unionists, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Poster at Aldi: Love at a discount
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that there are no romantic "How we met"-stories anymore in times of Tinder, should head over to Aldi and talk about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and other dating apps, the supermarket exudes an almost anachronistic romance as a place to meet ‘the one’.
Yeah, right. If in doubt, talking about discounted turkey meat, boxer shorts at the rummage table, or your favorite pudding is still a better story for your future grandchildren than a mere right swipe.
The app Tinder has the reputation of being less of a place to meet, but rather more of lewd exchange.
We made the test: How do women react, if you do not beat around the bush in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
There’s true Hollywood Lovestory potential with a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then messages his inamorata with the e-mail address organic-turkeymeat@gmail.com, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy at its best.
So, we wish the creator of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find the man of her dreams, with whom she had talked briefly about the "Organic turkey meat, 30 percent off".
We should all believe in the magic of analogue acquaintance. This woman definitely earned her Hollywood happy ending.
Billerbeck: 500 caps for a life without polio
Since the start of the new school year the Ludgerischule has been involved in the action ‘Caps against Polio - 500 caps for a life without polio’.
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus.
The disease referred to in German as child paralysis (Kinderlähmung) causes paralysis and even death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
A press release stated that to date the cause of poliomyelitis, the poliovirus, can only be contained by vaccination.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc demand rest for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on Mario Götze’s shape and fitness.
We should stop worrying about Mario.
That does not do him any good.
And it also does not do us any good, said Reuss, Götze’s friend, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen in an interview with the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized this before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: No rush for contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Bundesliga soccer team Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see any rush for a possible contract extension with trainer Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract up to now.
There is no fixed date when we will do so.
There will certainly come a moment, when we sit down and talk, said Eberl on Sunday evening on the Sky TV channel.
Football: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives hope
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.
All is history.
Meanwhile, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almost got promoted past season.
Yes, I am very happy with the appearance.
We made tightened spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of, praised Fetsch his boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for passes to him.
Wolbeck had much more time of possession in the first half.
And more opportunities
But Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost backfired when SCA’s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made two dangerous attacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After halftime, VfL boldly took complete control.
Thewes just barely failed with a shot from 18 meters.
Schroer was too late in minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided to freshen up the team on the left wing and put in Miles Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.
The fouled player himself stepped up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be in set play situations.
Westhues kicked the ball with his strong right and the goalie had to face the fact that he had failed: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes left on the clock, the game seemed to last forever.
Because then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally touched the ball in the box.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider was not ready to miss this opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had to endure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and secure the winning goal in minute 87.
That might have been overkill.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt beats Hannover 96 4:1
Background: Four points after five match days - coach Adi Hütter was not going to be happy with that.
Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to take the first home victory at last against Hannover 96.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, the accident happened at the airfield.
The four pasengers were slightly injured.
Around 14:00 drama occurred at the airport in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crash to the ground and came to land on its side.
The police, rescue services and fire department were notified immediately.
A large number of emergency services arrived at the site of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency rescue helicopter was also called as a precaution.
Passenger only slightly injured

AllBright Foundation Report: Women continue to be a rarity on executive boards
Only 8 percent of board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Monday by the AllBright Foundation, an advance copy of which had been made available to the German Press Agency.
The companies will have to make changes, otherwise international competitors will leave them behind, said foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, UK, or Sweden, male-only management teams have - with a few exceptions - been unthinkable for some time.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative, and future-oriented by comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the number of women in German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies in the mid-cap index (MDax).
Yet according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of boards are female.
In the previous year the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, there were 26 women working on the boards.
I am sure that Dax companies will be recruiting women more consistently in the coming year - it is in their own best interest, said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement showed no commitment to increase the “zero percent” to date.
The supervisory boards paint a different picture: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
If multiple women were recruited to the boards every year, a percentage of 40 percent would be achieved in 2023, it says in the report.

On this issue have been working the "Autopapst" and Professor of Economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The difference is significant.
Within the first half of year Ferrari got 69,000 euros of business profit for each sold car, Jaguar Land Rover only comes to around 800 euros, whereas Tesla and Bentley do not put emphasis on their income from each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are approaching with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros Earnings Before Interest and Tax.

With a torchlight parade, the tourism association of Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time the association organises the wine festivals which take place consecutively on every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on the Rehweiler road.
At the start of the jubilee the organisers, accompanied by the marching band from Wiesenbronn, moved through the town to the fairground.
The chairman of the tourist board, Wolfgang Starz, the mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess, Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already jam-packed marquee. ‘60 years to set something like this up, is a titanic challenge for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
‘This is a proud achievement’, said Starz thanking all the helpers.
Later the wine princess Lisa II symbolically clinked glasses with the guests from the stage.
It is great that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind. Later, "Die Troglauer" created good mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih (parish fair) was celebrated, the association set the drink prices in the afternoon as they were 60 years to celebrate the anniversary.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the house of the guests, before the next round, a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergeny ambulance crashes into a taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year old passenger was fatally injured when the ambulance collided with a taxi.
When emergency responders are called, they are supposed to help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn had a fatal end for a 26 year old.
Bonn - A 26 year old pedestrian was fatally injured when an ambulance collided with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency responder and her driver were seriously injured, police stated.
The 46 year old driver of the ambulance ran a red light on Saturday afternoon with the blue lights flashing and siren sounding.
He then crashed into a taxi at a crossroads that drove at the green light.
The doctor's car flew against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He swept away the passerby who died at the scene.
The ambulance driver and the taxi driver are seriously injured
The 62 year old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured and trapped in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency responder tried to do this, but without success.
The three seriously injured parties were taken to the hospital.
The police investigates in close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor, to find out who bears the blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, Mourinho’s situation is becoming uncomfortable
After the embarassing exit from the League Cup Manchester United now receives a loss in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU looses 1:3. The way of defeat certainly will remain a matter of discussion.
The scene in the 74th minute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3:1, was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford appeared to bring the Red Devils back into the game.
As the team suspected an offside in the pass by Mark Nobel, all of Manchester’s defensive players froze in position, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a very inadequate performance over long stretches.
The mood of United’s city rival, Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho’s big rival Pep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unchallenged 2:0 win.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling made the first breakthrough, through the defense of the outsiders, for the home team.
After a good hour Sergio Agüero secured the way for the sixth win in seven game, through a double pass of the previous goal scorer, which sprung the team to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer table leader
Three days after losing 1:2 at the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 with Liverpool against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As at the Cup exit the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the London team.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute was the only goal of match until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute only closely missed the tie goal after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his curl.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the London team eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the League, the Blues removed Liverpool now also from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs celebrated 2:0 wins against Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford).
The fans of the Gunners, under whose eyes Granit Xhaka played, against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, had to wait until the 81st minute wait for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end of the game the Watford defender Craig Cathcart unleashed a cross-field ball past Alex Iwobi into one’s own net. Only two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season which was decisive.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to its fifth successive win and are now fifth, just behind the great rivals Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to leave a strong impression as a team climbing in position under the Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row in the League with a 2:0 win over Southampton which places them in the eighth place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show marked by diesel debate
The Parisian automobile show takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet immanent The diesel scandal and struggle for bans on driving and upgrading should not let German car companies take part in the industry meeting in Paris.
Next week they will be showing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the capital of French together with its competitors from all over the world.
The diesel does not really matter now.
The possible exchange and modernization offers for diesel engines owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind shiny exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Here are presented Audi and Mercedes-Benz, including their first pure-electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt should come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented however.
The launch of BMW iNext is scheduled for 2021.
In the focus of attention in Paris is the new 3ER.
This year from October 4 to 14, more than 250 exhibitors are being represented.
In addition to the car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers will be there in their individual halls.
The trade show, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 came over one million visitors.
At least 380 people have lost their lives on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken on Friday by two earthquakes.
The first quake was of magnitude 5.9, the second of magnitude 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged among the severe property damage.
After the earthquake the tsunami erupted over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will definitely increase.
Numbers are so far only from Palu.
But numerous other communities along Sulawesi's west coast are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate a church service in Werdohl
On Sunday, Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne, celebrated the concluding service with a team of helpers for motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the concluding service for the bikers was to be held here.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor in the Evangelical church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral interests of the high-HP cyclists.
Between April and September on the last Sunday of the month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Nordhelle house.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There, some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday for a church service that was anything but ordinary.
Starting from 10 am, the heavy bikes lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
The biker brunch was the first agenda item and attendees had a chance to tuck into some coffee and cake or even a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also in attendance.
Priest Dirk Grzegorek gave a sermon during the biker church service.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill accompanied the service with her music.
Although the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill struck rather calm and poetic notes, said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was definitely a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorf's Home Association celebrates a major festival: The milk comes after the apple
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big amount of interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the life of an apple to his astonished spectators step by step from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink was to be made from it.
But they could even witness this important step on the late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which looked a bit like chopped shreds.
Thanks to certain technical support, the last work step was now no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a big vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his “treasure chest” and presented the latest Federweisser [alcoholic beverage] to the older visitors.
There was a lot of demand for the good “Made in Füchtorf” beverage.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents got to talking while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited people to join in fun games at several stations.
The Home Association will also offer an action day next year.
Then, however, emphasized Gregor Krützkamp, the community center in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the site of the action.
Instead, a farmer will be visited.
That is also obvious because of the topic: Because then, it will all be about milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover facing fourth washout this season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were not many positives to take away from the bottom team’s earlier 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frankfurt.
It is a crappy situation, but you have to come out on the other side as a team, said 96 player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This is of course disappointing, because you always try for the best result possible".
Victory continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored to narrow the gap. They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and must be considered a relegation candidate in their current form.
By contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middle of the table on seven points.
Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move by the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hannover’s defense struggled to reign him in.
The striker battered after the World Cup, showed by his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was called up to Frankfurt’s starting eleven for the first time and the team got off to a dynamic start.
The first sign of danger came in the form of Lucas Torró’s header (17th), which was deflected into the netting.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped by 96’s defense in a promising position. The defenders were led by the Brazilian Felipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injury.
The home side’s lead was all but inevitable and completely justified.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to tap it in.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had joined the club during the summer.
And Frankfurt increased the tally before the break.
This time, Haller passed to his fellow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the end of the match when they at least managed to score and narrow the gap.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who just tapped the ball into the empty goal.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy for the rest of the match, which also saw Jovic scoring with one minute to go.
The Morlaixplatz turns into a party strip
Würselen Despite the cool temperatures, the atmosphere was great at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
In front of millions of spectators, Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter opened the 185th
Münchener Wies’n last week needing only two strokes.
Geisingen: Christians in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival
Catholics in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or on the Sunday after.
The festival service takes place at the town church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the blessing.
At the Church of the Holy Cross lies Christus, who witnessed the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Christus' resting place, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
The construction is not finished yet, only the sanctuary is, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Inspite of the importance for the Geising parish, attendance was rather poor.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing concluded the ecclesiastical part of the cross festival.
The Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home for many years.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a big selection of cakes and, appropriate for the weather, farm-fresh ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which will last until next year.
After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the already existing damage hase worsended over the last few years, but also more damaged has been uncovered, which was only possible through the inspection by means of the scaffold.
The plinth plastering work is completed and before the winter, the natural stone work will begin and the involved parties hope to finish about half of this work this year.
Opening ceremony: New residential home in Neu-Ulm’s Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller life aid is opening a new hostel for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those attending the ceremony agreed that "a very special house" is now opening its doors for its intended purpose.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home provided by Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on its unique architecture.
Wider aisles, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have all been part of architect Rudolf Bader’s concept.
Planning first began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officers’building was tested for its suitability for residents with disabilities: "The house was getting old and no longer up-to-date in terms of features," Bader explained looking back.
In 2016, excavators started rolling to demolish the house.
The new building was to be designed to be as welcoming and bright as possible, so that the residents could feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential home
The life aid invested approximately 4.6 million euro in the new construction.
The state of Bavaria contributed 2.4 million Euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 Euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financially.
The Lebenshilfe’s managing director Jürgen Heinz thanked Bader this accomplishment.
The balance between a barrier-free and fireproof design has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and handymen built a home with many specifications, to allow residents the freedom to move even without outside help.
The same was expressed by the head of social services in the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘The home is geared towards the special requirements of its residents, who need help with mobility’.
Comfort and functionality have been combined to good effect in the process, said Kreutmayer.
And also: ‘The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it no longer needs to be acquired in today’s situation’.
All in all, the new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are paid union wages.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the anniversary of German unification, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to the nation not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity
We cannot permit ourselves to be satisfied with these differences,” said the minister president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the “Tagesspiegel” on Sunday.
The goals must remain the same: to create equal living conditions across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work longer on average than people in Western Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
This is inexplicable, nearly 30 years after the German Unification, said Schwesig.
North Korea: Is this cute dog going to end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is to pour oil on troubled water between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hounds as a gift.
On Sunday, Moons office announced that both dogs, about a year old reached the recipient already on Thursday.
They passed through the Panmunjom border with three kilograms of dog food, to help the animals ‘to settle in’.
The dogs with their thick, white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift was announced by the North at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to make a joint candidancy for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the process of the mutual rapprochement, Kim agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test system for rocket propulsion.
99 documents reflect Austria's eventful history
What is Austria?
At the 100-year anniversary of the republic that has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, many new books appeared that answer this question mainly looking back over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different approach in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on October 1.
A new week, a new opportunity for the government
Back to regulatory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke the mantra "return to work".
That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference really is between work and paperwork, but that's all.
Now the federal government is ready to devote itself again to the task of governing, they should not be distracted from this now with debates on terminology.
Whether Union and SPD can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of recent weeks, will possibly be seen on Monday.
The leaders of the governing parties will come together for the coalition committee in the evening.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to summon this session regularly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons can be learned from all the disputes.
First of all, however, conflict-laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration law.
The SPD promotes a long-term perspective for failed asylum-seekers, who work or who are training.
The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum system into the labor market.
There will be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But to be constructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of being or not-being.
It is about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to argue - but must always have the reality of life of the people in view.
What is possible and is of benefit to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and confidence thereby regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must now fight for.
Pilz is investigating the Hartinger’s working hours
Close eyes on Minister
Is the Ministor for Labor in violation of labor law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to investigate this in more detail.
Seriously, day and night, her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported the social minister at the presentation of the reform two weeks ago exuberantly.
Liste Pilz candidate Daniela Holzinger is surprised by Beate Hartinger-Klein’s statement (FPÖ) - she brings this to the parliament’s attention now.
She assumes that ‘the minister is only trying to express her enthusiasm about the engagement of her team, and did not intend to convey any possible violations of the labor law with the cameras rolling’.
Nevertheless, now there are unanswered questions to acquit Hartinger "of any suspicion."
The police dig up a road in search of a woman’s corpse
Marxgrün - Lange did not want to comment on the matter to the police.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning digging has taken place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track in the Marxgrün area will be closed until Monday.
Earlier it had taken place that the investigator had used an archeology dog.
The dog together with his guide, trained especially for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant area to a few metres.
A soil anomaly was also discovered with scientists from Munich’s Technical University and the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the road section mentioned.
For more than a year already the prosecutor and Criminal Police from Hof had worked on the case of the missing.
A cycle track was closed again and again at Marxgründ and investigated with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspected that Heike’s body could have been buried during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colored powder and eggs: Protests in Barcelona before the Catalonia’s anniversary
The controversial independence referendum took place on Monday in Catalonia.
But right before it begun the protests.
The autumn 2017 police operation was not forgotten by the separatists.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, in the downtown of Barcelona separatists clashed with police.
Among other things Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with colored powder, as they were trying to prevent them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.
With the demonstration about 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illegal referendum.
An attempt to prevent citizens from voting lead to violence.
The Spanish media reported that the Catalan police formed a chain to keep the separatists and central security forces apart.
However, some of the about 6000 separatists tried to break the police chain by force, and were throwing at officials, among other things, paint bombs and eggs.
Citing the authorities it was said that six people had been arrested and 24 other were slightly injured.
The independence referendum took place for the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to split off the prosperous region from Spain, in autumn 2017 the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under control.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont has fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also escaped abroad.
However, several ministers of then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
In December in the region were held new elections.
After the new Catalan government's inauguration in May, the forced administration was terminated.
Yet the new president insists on the ‘Right of self-determination’ of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going nowhere.
FC Gütersloh only didn’t get further than a 0-0 draw.
The tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
The first half was rather dim in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or bratwurst could do it without worrying they would miss anything.
There was no risk of missing a goal opportunity, because there were virtually none.
The first shot on goal happened after half an hour.
Responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh’s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 32.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury. Sinan Aygün replaced him.
After the substitution, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quickly dealt with.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they went one better with a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a corner from former Ahlen player Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little later Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).
That lead to nothing.
The team from Ahlen did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but that did not get them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we kept a clean sheet." But unfortunately, both sides scored zero.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as against Holzwickede, even though our opponents did not want to play here, states RW Ahlen’s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I did not feel that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the viewer did not feel like his team could score a goal, either.
The performance was too poor for that.
Thanksgiving Market in Reckenfeld: Good thing there are enough Kreimers
That is good news for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers clarify: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening the sky was a brilliant blue, but the square was a little empty, which was to change over the day.
Because: "It is such a friendly atmosphere, that is why we are here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in a Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a bit of humor.
At short notice, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stood in for the Brockmanns, who were to be weighed against food.
Ferdi Kreimer’s daughter Verena had fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers anyway.
And the "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the ever increasing number of visitors.
This was so well received that people sang along to some folk songs late at night.
Just great, said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
This year, mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule.
He is happy to see so many engaged people manning their stands, most of them hailing from clubs and associations.
Strictly speaking, there should be no need for things like food banks, he said when thanking the men’s choir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek praised everybody’s engagement, in the stands, and also included the additional festivals that took place in September and the ‘clean-up’ action.
Our garden city is getting a colorful coat of paint - things are really happening.
Next, the wreath was taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken into winter storage.
Many stands worked to provide sustenance.
Everything from sweet to savory was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative about his scroll saw.
He offered veneer designs and beer mats with typical Reckenfeld motifs, among other things.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty on hand.
Gingerbread in a glass, with honey from my own production of course.
Little Elsa kept coming back for seconds, that is how good the cake was.
It is this friendly atmosphere that makes visitors stay late into the evening hours even in the absence of stage events, which are not part of the fall festival.
Graffiti with a local political message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have advocated for the construction of a skate park in a hardly beneficial way.
In several places, there are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint for property damage has been filed with the police.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed in large letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that writing was found on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the career choice fair.
Since the short message was apparently "only" made with a marker, it could easily be removed.
A few days later, it was there again, but this time it was sprayed on, says Rottmann.
He assumes that the respective advertising sign has to be replaced.
This case is special by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the graffitied board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of a skate park.
After the old had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began.
The council finally chose the fire department parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - apparently, too many factors were against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, it was all turned around again.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg school.
Regarding the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council has the last word.
He assumes a decision will be reached this year, so that park can be built in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic control are getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffic in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
This year it was only wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit after that, head of the German air traffic union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said that the well known staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix to this problem.
Airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five years, the unionist said.
He added that there are hardly any fully trained air traffic controllers available on the European market.
He pointed out that the Karlsruhe center monitoring Germany’s upper air space alone is short of some one hundred staff.
Maas again criticized the fact that different air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from federal and state governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, that will not work without us, said the head of the German air traffic union, many members of which work for the federally owned German air traffic control company DFS.
Maas again held the EU Commission’s guidelines responsible for the air traffic control predicament.
He asserted that traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services now have a severe impact on daily operations, he stressed.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulations in Brussels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxygen".
He cautioned that, as things stand, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, the EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they have sown in recent years, said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs incurred by the airlines as a result of delays will lead them to think again.
The German air traffic union would work to improve the situation only if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented training and education," said Maas.
He further noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related personnel reductions.
It does not yet address the necessary staff expansion.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the plans for the reorganization of the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim head, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed to the meeting on Sunday for the management board, the crisis-hit group will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will have their registered office in Essen and will be listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no further downsizing in addition to the reductions already known about.
After two withdrawals, the supervisory body only has eight heads on the capital side.
And there are ten employee representatives.
The final decision will be made in a general meeting planned in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to hold a 50-percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to be bundled with the elevator and subcontracting business.
Barcelona: Police brutality and violent Catalan independence activists at demonstrations.
Violent clashes by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona with numerous casualties at two concurrent demonstrations.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence activists demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protesting groups away from each other.
According to deployment forces, advocates for independence again tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and thrown objects.
Brawls between the participants of the two protesting groups were also reported.
24 people were injured according to the rescue forces.
The police stated there have been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central government.
They demanded better salaries at the same time.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much more than they were.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
Why did they come here to protest? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Simply to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who said his name is Daniel, rejected the accusation.
Of course we want to support our comrades who were only doing their job a year ago: defending the law, he said.
But the demonstration is here to enforce our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona, because it is a major European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues did “not come here to provoke,” the policeman ensured us.
Crash allowed access to personal data of British minister
A security hole in a mobile app led to the personal data of ministers and representatives of the Conservative British Tory party on Saturday being temporarily accessible to anyone.
According to British media reports, many ministers received calls from unknowns after the crash, one day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people clamped on B217
On Sunday morning the Hanover police reported a heavy traffic accident on the federal highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the outskirts of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died after driving their car into a tree.
Currently, the car is in flames.
Emergency services are at the scene.

Football: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo’s best game
The Portuguese star striker ‘this evening played the best game in addition to Valencia’s half hour’, commended Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star without scoring himself was the decisive man of the match in the important game against the pursuers.
Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well, said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal and we just got better from then onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three assists, Juve struck back in the game after being down early through the goal by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) and in the thick of things the pursuer was put off for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double score (26./49.) for the lead.
And Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for the goal by the defence leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to make a short push in, in front of the goal line.
He gives a lot, said the trainer.
But naturally Allegri will also see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.
We have to get better at serving him, the coach said.
Currently Mandzukic is the best Juve scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
The superiority of Juventus seems even more overwhelming, with the purchase of Ronaldo, for more than 100 million Euros.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Series A. With 21 points the masters over the past seven years already have a six-point lead over Napoli.
The second team in the table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.
The top match was however decided at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.).
The Portuguese after a too strong pile in against Paulo Dybala had to leave the field with a yellow-red.
We played well against a good Napoli, the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can should also feel addressed.
The German national has asserted himself at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool, participated in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by the ‘half hour’: Ronaldo was sent off at the 2:0 Turin win and is barred for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
On the weekend, with a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused raised eyebrows and questions among the spectators.
On time for the release of his new album, the 41 year old additionally announced a name change.
From now on, one may call him only "Ye", so the musician.
The artist, formerly known as Kanye West, twittered in the style of the dead singer Prince, when he changed his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album has appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL the artist explains that ‘Ye’ has a religious significance for him.
I think ‘Ye’ is the most frequently used word in the bible and means ‘you’, the rapper said.
Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar’s trainer Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game by us today.
The opponent was just easier to grip, we have almost never faced problems." Accordingly thin reads the list of Hoetmarer bullet options.
Just two scoring chances in 90 minutes. Not a good chance for a positive outcome.
Football District League A1: SC Hoetmar and SG Sendenhorst played 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG had only two options in the first round, but Maik Krause used the first from an acute angle to secure the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have upped the score, but after great preparation work by Krause he missed the ball.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Höne failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper Jos Schuhmacher.
After halftime, the guests were even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (minute 49), Julian Turl (minute 61) and Heinz Linnemann (minute 69) all failed.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann had rescued on the goal line with the hand and got the red card - was also not of use for the guests (minute 75).
Only once Nils Berheide poked the ball across the line was the game over (81st minute).
We had previously criticized ourselves hard, that was different today than in the last few weeks, was Florian Kraus’ conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th minute Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th minute (Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (minute 7), 0-2 Berheide (minute 81).
Red card: Kortenjann (minute 75/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh falls against Concordia 3-4
I do not know what to think of that, he struggled for words.
We did not get any access to them. With ‘them’, he allegedly meant the wing players Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green and whites, who made themselves noticeable with their collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A filthy win," he said, winking cheekily and then went off. His players, on the other hand, were relieved to have gotten away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for staying in the league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes.
That was by far our best performance of the season, he says.
It was phenomenal how we come back from the 0-2 draw and held up against one of the league's top teams over the entire match.
Hence, the more bitter it seems, that they had to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner shot his team in the lead with his 12th. Goal this season (minute 24).
He needed exactly two touches in this game for this goal.
The 2-0, he set for Fabian Fröhning (minute 39).
We knew it, but you just can't completely take out a player like that.
It was amazing what he did, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized the opponent’s quality.
Just before switching sides, his own team managed to score the equalizer: McGill’s free kick from the left side sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).
After switching sides, it was McGill again who scored the equalizer (59th minute).
And then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten (minute 64), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized again (minute 69).
Despite their numerical advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (minute 80).
Now, we must focus on Wednesday.
The game against Schapdetten, that’s one we have to win now, said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th minute Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th minute Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (minute 24), 2-0 Fröhning (minute 39), 2-1 McGill (minute 45), 2-2 McGill (minute 59), 3-2 Nübel (minute 64), 3-3 P. Horstmann (minute 69), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (minute 80).
Indirect Red: Atalan (minute 74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins one point against Primus
There was no winner in the soccer league Landesliga dual between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leaders had actually come for three points, but Oliver Pfaff’s team was very good and ended the game 0-0.
Media: Dynamo Dresden’s entire executive board have resigned
The entire executive board of second division football club Dynamo Dresden have resigned according to media reports.
In the evening several media outlets consistently referred to a joint written statement from the club’s board.
The club did not provide a confirmation at first.
Internal power struggles inside the former Bundesliga club are cited as reasons for the step.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pageantry
Good that he’s gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure creates as great a sense of relief in Germany as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days and many thought he should never have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
Until the middle of the following year the Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has shown interest to personally claim the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: As Federal President he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff has been as a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have visited us". That celebrities appear again and again at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter, Konstantin Wecker took part in a session about spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann will be at a session about his Grandfather Thomas Mann.
France’s President Emmanuel has also confirmed: He wants to accept the “Prize for Tolerance” awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing in person, the TV presenter Dunja Hayali is also receiving something in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 are with essence.
The pension is not even safe! says a conference title.
SOS at Europe’s borders - this is how the Academy describes the ‘risky and fatal route across the Mediterranean’.
And a conference about Syria: Barbarism without limit’.
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war makes a mockery of the humane’.
The spectrum of events extends from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor as well as to the radical change of work through digitisation.
Academy Director, Hahn was not convinced: ‘A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together, to look for solutions or at least partial solutions’.
Soon at a conference celebrating the 200th
birthday of Karl Marx, some will be awaiting more visitors in the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others more likely a tendency "from left to centre".
What about neutrality?
We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the evangelical national church, said Director of Studies, Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, ‘but we are not 100 percent neutral’.
Satirical revue: Gender communication from the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
Tina Teubner’s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for adults as well as men".
Comedian Teubner honed in on gender communication with humor and empathy for the (stereotypical) woman and the (stereotypical) man - and anything else that out there - but also with music.
They played mini guitar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süverkrüp was manning the piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congenially and in harmony, so much so that some may have wished a solo.
Then there was this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, so as to fit the theme of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man is happy when he has a partner but does not hold the door open for her.
But that a closed door without a partner, on the other hand, offers no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrated this very notion: How would Mozart’s career as a composer turned out, if his older sister "the Nannerl" had suddenly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach’s "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Death Rattle" Western theme, and from Mozart’s G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and shouts of "bravo" from the packed hall.
The association’s treasurer, Karlheinz Kleintje, presented flowers to the singer.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused to part without offering additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to a gig in Wolbeck in addition to their appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Bruchsal.
Following a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have amended the number of victims to a slightly lower figure.
10 instead of 15 passengers are now reported to have been slightly injured.
All are now said to have been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital over night for observation.
It will be released over the day, a police spokesperson said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is reportedly still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed into a guardrail on Saturday morning at full speed.
Handball: Women Division: Ahlener SG keeps a clean sheet against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen players especially had trouble with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals on her own.
I was actually pretty satisfied with the defense. Only one player scored too many goals.
We did not get that under control, said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
He was more annoyed by the many opportunities that were left on the table.
The focus at the end made his team miss the victory this time.
The ASG lagged behind until the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (minute 45).
Towards the end, the broader bench of the hosts made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu Rückraum put Merle Klement on the left wing, who then made "decisive goals in an extremely clever way" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: Top performance by BSV Ostbevern in the championship game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have established themselves again in the top group of the 3. League West.
On the home field of relegated club’s VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-white won with 3-1.
It was a huge step in a cool season.
It’s so much fun to play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have been working towards, says trainer Dominik Münch excitedly after an almost flawless performance by his team at the now defeated table leader.
In the first part, the guests dominated almost however they wanted.
With 4-1, 16-10 and 22-12, the runner-up of the previous year won with a 25-15.
Essen played with two lines, but has not come into play.
We kept them on their toes.
Our opponent struck with a high risk, but also produced countless penalty cards.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12-8. "Essen changed to three lines.
We could not hold the pressure.
Essen moved in closer, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were in front.
Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
The game was now in a better class, believes the trainer about the performance.
Maike Rüdingloh and then Wiebke Silge made huge contributions with their serves that BSV turned the page in the third set from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
At 7-3 and 15-13, the blue-white added part four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an outstanding day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Mosque was opened in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can be put together only with difficulty, said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German side missed the opportunity to have a joint reconciliatory appearance.
Instead of highlighting the Muslims’ affiliation with Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the event for his own purposes, complained Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had encouraged "many reservations."
Nottuln Home Association: The offer has already been established
It’s Folk Festival time again finally after the long summer break
On October 18th (Thursday) at 19:30, the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the old Amtmannei.
It’s almost exactly a year to the day since we met here for a Folk Festival for the first time.
This event has now become a fixture in the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Home Association, pleased.
I would not have thought that our Folktreff got established so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was the storm Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the ‘Amtmannei’ was always full.
As always, the program for the next Folk Festival is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, evergreens an old hits, says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always inviting musical friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised to play his accordion for the first Folk Festival “birthday.”
He was a member of “Gaitling” many years ago, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's a member of an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folk Festival fondly remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schultz from the Folk Festival Emsdetten excited the audience with his international version of the song “Frogs in the Night” and sent them home with the song stuck in their heads.
We are expecting many happy guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening together, says the invitation from the Home Association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always taken quickly, it’s recommended to get there early enough.
The Folk Festival will start at 7:30 pm, but admission begins at 7 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons all open questions must be clarified by October 24.
Frankfurt Linde and Praxair are one step further to becoming the world’s largest industrial gases company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that only the authorisations from South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still outstanding for the multi-billion dollar merger.
The chances of the approval of an insider has improved recently as a result, because Linde has confirmed the sale of additional company parts.
All outstanding issues must be resolved by October 24th for legal reasons, for the merger to succeed.
From clean fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation was celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebrated the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the association had a different name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach City and Country).
The purpose of the fruit-growing association differed from that of today’s work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite, explained the local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees lined the highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Today fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.
But by far that is not the end of the scope.
Gardening close to nature, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge about healthy diets and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
Youth work is critically important, especially in the digital age, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was for us as children a huge thing, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner .
Where the trees will be planted will be decided by the district association, added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, was also stated without doubt by the county manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about the long history of the district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the war.
In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter conserves were made.
At the end of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live-in garden.
Nature endures, it existed before us and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded the specialist in fruit and nut trees.
There is an incentive therefore for the gardening associations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful and worth living.
Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associations, explained the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was festively framed by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau music association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister reschedules UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity in Nafta issues: Both trading partners are set an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister is now giving trading agreements absolute priority - and is delaying her speech for the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure involved in the struggle for a new edition of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, the Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of today, Saturday, the minister will not speak before the United Nations general assembly until Monday, shared her spokesperson Adam Austen.
In the meantime she will concentrate on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday the Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo explained that Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been made between his country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed on a new version of the regional Nafta free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in future.
The talks concerning revision have been ongoing for over a year.
They will have concluded by Sunday evening (local time) and Trump’s government will submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
On Friday Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced that should the negotiations fail then Mexico would attempt achieving a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has been released from the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to his hometown Río de Janeiro.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will attend any events in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the street in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (English: "Not him"), especially women's associations protested against the ex-military.
The associations also took to social media to protest against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic hub São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of former president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.
The presidential election in Brazil will be on October 7.
As the former mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro according to polls.
The “Trump of Brazil” has been in politics for a long time, but only recently has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff election on October 28th.
Experts assume that Bolsonaro will not be victorious - no matter who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for being against gay and black people and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks the people of Brazil with verbal derailments over and over again.
Once he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Labor Party should be shot dead.

Following a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 following a long illness, shared his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen’s website.
Larsen was surrounded on his deathbed by his wife and six children.
Since the beginning of the year the musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer.
Larsen became famous with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, after the dissolution of the band, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone’s hearts."
The head of government also recalled that in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Larsen performed on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
A night of rock in the shoe factory: Loud as a jackhammer
Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a tiger. The band names Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music event on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the community center housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who are also friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians take time for a group photo.
There is no hint of stage fright in the process.
Afterwards, the lead singers and their bands from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - visibly enthrall the approximately 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito rock night with their loud performances.
Kicking things off, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pieces, which the band penned themselves for their soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, people dance to the powerful yet harmonious band performance.
Despite loud calls for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw then hand over the reigns to the three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard rock with their alternative sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Following the high energy rock of the Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on top of the guitar sound.
Among other titles, the yearning, almost ballad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by switching between melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation since the band formed in 2005.
The band presented their full-energy hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour.
Playing off his band, Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann has his very own take on the evening’s only cover - Word Up by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it feels like the volume is dialed up even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a solo while running through the cheering crowd.
Of course, when it comes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibel level has to be expected: According to the sound crew, that level was around 98 decibels for the three band concert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito night of rock.
That is approximately the same level as a jackhammer, which is still significantly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festival referenced on the band website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience has no need during this night of rock for 120 decibel sound as loud as a jet engine, as is common at the heavy metal get together in the north of Germany.
After just under four hours, the three hard rock bands have long since won the audience over with their confident, expert performance and own songs.
In the end, all three bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the strength of a tiger."
Above all, they enjoyed the plentiful applause from the audience.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
On Sunday a glider crashed into the parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Close to Mülheim/Essen airport a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the ‘Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung’, a glider crashed into the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was reportedly killed.
The WAZ further reported that the student pilot was alone on board - the aircraft was apparently a one-seater.
According to reports, the aircraft had already been on its landing approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a marquee within airport premises.
However, starting this weekend, an Oktoberfest is being held.
The Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the ramp to highway 52.
During large events at the Essen conference center or the city’s Grugahalle venue, a park and ride service is offered from the parking lot.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President is well disposed towards North Korea’s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
This is also linked to Kim’s ‘wonderful letters’.
At the tender age of 72 years, the married US president has a new flame.
The tragic thing is: It is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, in total public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Supporters in the US federal state of West Virginia have heard tender words from Trump for the descendant from the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang half his age, although the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a particularly tough job.
I was tough and so was he, it went backwards and forwards between us, reported Trump.
Then we fell in love.
OK?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also bore fruit politically: Trump pointed to Kim’s announced to halt all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics say it is mere cheap talk.
The US president seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fond of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump’s nickname for Kim.
He accepted the expected criticism during his appearance at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘Donald Trump says, they have fallen in love’.
How terrible, how terrible is this?
That is so unpresidential.
He cared little for that, said Trump, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be presidential."
But 10,000 people outside would not be surging into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.
The Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler was very well-attended, with a great atmosphere and plenty of sunshine: Very diversified and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweilers city dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not just held in the marquee at the Feuerwehr tower, but on Sunday was extended into the city by the trade association.
Thanks to video from Libyan prison, refugees are rescued
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya which has made it possible for them to be rescued.
At the risk of their lives, the group had shot the video in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
They refuse to send us back, said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here. We are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website “France 24 Observers,” whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were ultimately flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
Without the video, we likely would not have been able to return to Nigeria, said Efe Onyeka, who made the video, according to the news agency AFP.
The 25-year old was arrested in Libya when attempting to make her way into Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he said he risked his own life.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions in jail were catastrophic; “They beat all of us with pipes and sticks.”
They didn't give us anything to eat. We had to drink out of the latrine.
The IOM organized the voluntary repatriation of the refugees who were stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home in the West African country this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo.
Given the poor conditions in Libya, this case of the now rescued Nigerians is no exception.
However, a call for help via mobile phone video was new to them.
International organizations are criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African country, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main country of passage for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
On Sunday afternoon, when a teacher went to the Ort elementary school to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50 the teacher entered the building by the main entrance.
In the entrance hall of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately ran away.
First through a door, then across the roof terrace, a staircase on the ground floor and the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who started investigations.
It is not possible to say whether items or money were stolen.
Witness description: about 16 years old, black, short-haired, dark appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

A German was trapped in his automobile for days
A 75 year old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forested area in Middle Franconia, after his car got stuck away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a meadow and freed the person considered missing since Tuesday evening, the police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was apparently found in a healthy conditions despite the cold nights and long period without supplies.
He said he is now pleased to be home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family, when on Tuesday he did not return from a journey in his SUV across local grassland and fields.
The whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days, despite intensive search efforts.
Laschet urges Turkey to act according to the rule of law
Cologne - According to the Minister President of NRW Armin Laschet (CDU), during his talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships of both countries are currently ‘overshadowed’, Laschet said on Saturday, following a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
These concerns are related to all the arrest waves, freedom of media and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that "if in the future relations are going to become normal and if economic relations are going to deepen, then the rule of law is a very important condition."
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans being imprisoned in Turkey.
He had expressed the hope that freedom of expression would be respected.
Thereupon Erdogan once again underlined the independence of Turkish system of justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to the building of the Executive Transport Wing of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it should have taken place at Wahn castle - but the castle owners declined due to political views against Erdogan.
After the speech Erdogan went to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet declined a joint appearance in the building.
He did say though: ‘The Muslims who go to this mosque, are also citizens of our country’.
And we are their contact persons - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President, Trump does not tire of highlighting the success of negotiations over North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is describing relations more demurely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the UN General Debate, has accused the US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued sanctions.
The recent standstill has seen the US implementing coercive measures, which are lethal to trust-building, said Ri in New York.
Disarmament under these circumstance would be unthinkable for North Korea.
Without any trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves first, the North Korean head diplomat said.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘brought to its knees’ due to the sanctions, is ‘a pipe dream of people who don’t know us’.
To build trust his country has stopped its atom and missile tests and has destroyed a nuclear test system, Ri said.
However, the USA has shown no "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Nations.
Concurrently, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met with North Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore the US President is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will be traveling to Pyongyang again for talks about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors of the House of the Open Door (HoT) didn’t realise the fact that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
Youth from the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the youth wanted to express their thanks with the meal.
The start was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break, and we were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: A power outage had cut the power to the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be thrown out.
Now we had to start from the beginning again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and youth wanted to do it alone, says Westbuer.
And so everyone helped.
The result was impressive and the guests were excited.
Professional chefs could not do any better either, an impressed visitor said, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served and the guests enjoyed quiche, meatloaf or cake.
It is really great what the children and young people have put together, said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed the guests with card tricks and other performances.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW executive board of the Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Tafel had introduced a limit for foreigners.
He had resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW Tafel, said Sartor to the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many had stabbed me in the back.
The head of the NRW association of the Tafel, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding for the decision of his longtime deputy to dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism to heart.
I can understand his step - many people spoke up who did not even know exactly why the Essen Tafel does that.
But Sartor is still working for the Essener Tafel - “six days a week, nothing has changed about it,” says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues from other Tafel associations in "Welt am Sonntag.".
One should not think, "that without us, people in the city would be starving."
It would be the government’s obligation to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The man from Essen did not participate at a congress of the Tafel in Berlin on Friday.
They’re oversimplifying it all, he said.
There are all those do-gooders who criticized me so much back then.

The VfB Stuttgart also received its first victory.
The Stuttgarters had to take fear of the Werder Bremen, which already before the end of the first half-time had been reduced to a team of ten because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.

The Gladbachers, using the Swiss quartett line-up of Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave away the lead twice, but ultimately achieved a 2:2 score, which means that since the year 2003 they still await an away win in the VW city.
Renato Steffen was responsible for the 1:1 tie goal for Wolfsburg, which was his second goal in the Bundesliga.
The Aargauer Yann Sommer was powerless against the low shot from 20 metres, as well as against the second goal against an hour later.

Macedonians are to agree on a new state name
In Macedonia around 1.8 million citizens will today agree whether the name of their country in North Macedonia should be changed.
A yes could help settle the dispute with neighboring Greece that has been simmering for nearly three decades.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and sought to block any Macedonian advances to the West.
Voters are therefore also deciding on the country’s future integration into the West.
The USA have announced that the country could quickly become a Nato member if there is a positive outcome from the referendum.
Syrian detained awaiting trial.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three senior citizens partially causing severe injuries.
On Friday at about 22.00 the 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the policemen arrived, they questioned the accused about his behavior, who with clenched fists attempted to attack passers-by.
The Syrian thereafter tried to beat and kick the officials.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had recently beaten three older ladies (aged 65, 67, 75) in the Währinger street, at a tram stop with his fists bringing them to the ground.
Additionally he stomped on the trio with his feet.
The senior citizens were partially seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruising and concussion.
The police stated, the asylum seeker was also seriously injured, "through causes still requiring identification."
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout his treatment.
SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost a year after marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the ‘Bild’ newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them.
If we get married, we want to do it properly. He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs speaks on budgetary policy for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
Kahrs had caused quite a stir with an angry speech on June 30, 2017 during a parliamentary debate over allowing homosexuals to get married.
For example, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality of status with marriage, for example concerning adoption laws.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedge trimmed
The members of the citizens’ association Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde were faced with a lot of work.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhause had to be trimmed.
Supported by the residents, about twelve helpers went to work.
We are doing this to reduce costs, explained the chairman of the citizens’ association Walter Schröer.
And a lot of costs have accumulated.
Because of the hot summer, we're late getting started, but fortunately it’s just some profile trimming.
Because they had already cut the hedge in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
Everyone should eat to have enough energy, said Walter Schröer.
World championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner receives gold at the canoe slalom world championships
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old completed a perfect run on the Olympic stretch.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, having done plenty of runs on this setup, and today everything went perfectly’, said the Olympic bronze medalist from London 2012.
At the finish line, he threw away his paddle for joy and victoriously stretched both arms into the air - knowing that it would at least be enough for a medal.
After all, he started at number four.
Yet the six remaining starters could not top his best time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech, Jiri Prskavec came second in front of the Russian, Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspection announces the first attempted break-in this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the culprits failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars are taking advantage of this.
Yesterday the police station Gauting reported the first break-in attempt of this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that the attempt in the Königswieser Straße at the single family home remained as such.
On Friday just before 20.00 the alarm rang when the offenders took action.
The burglars assumed the inhabitants were not at home.
Yet apparently the alarm surprised them so much that they fled without loot.

The fall of Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bayern calls for Ajax
The title of unbeatable is gone: The defeat in Berlin will not allow the FC Bayern to give up.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the interim conclusion for Niko Kovac’s tenure.
Under no circumstances should the first small drop in power with the new coach Niko Kovaca should increase for Munich to the autumn minimum.
A week ago, everyone still thought we were unbeatable.
Now we are overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and asks for a return leg in the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, is aware that we are really angry and that is why we will crank up on Tuesday.
For the first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no goals, as at the same time two mandatory preseason games in series without a victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the champions shall be aware.
The FC Augsburg with the 1:1 ratio having its long running man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through its playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered within two days two similar blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those who know Bayern are aware that we will not put up with that and that we will do everything to become successful again, Kovac said.
Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native city with his losers and put his first defeat as Munich coach down to the inadequate handling of opportunities.
A win over Amsterdam and Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
So before the second premier class appearance in this season after the 2-0 over Benfica Lisbon, Kovac undertook no extraordinary measures.
As it was planned, after the day off on Sunday started quick preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.
Now they’ve scored a victory over us in two games, but we will also reach our goals again, announced captain of the national team Manuel Neuer.
Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kimmich.
The right defender take on the role of admonisher.
I do not believe that this is all bad luck, we need to work it out again, because we do not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season Bayern was even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over with one point ahead.
And so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, that now the public debate about supposedly invincible Bavaria has ended.
Yes, that’s good, said the national player.
It is a good thing for the league.
DFB boss comes under fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack of Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish president Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany amidst serious accusations.
The DFB president Grindel admits mistakes but upholds the association’s line.
Now will be created a new post.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.
After the Turkish President criticized the speech of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of DFB upheld the association’s line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, who had been personally attacked by Özil, reported on the consequences of the issue on the Mainz ZDF “Sport studio”.
As we have a lot of players with a migration background in the U teams, in future we must draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this does not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player without a migration background as an additional integration official.
Grindel also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The latter was very critical of the racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed with them in England," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact that our two young men, who had been risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, after the World Cup affair, which had been taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt that he was "reasonably treated by the DFB".
He also said he wanted to stand up for players in future.
That thing they say: If I win - I’m German, if I lose - I’m a migrant - that will not work.
I am very sorry that he had such an impression, said Grindel.
I’ve always said that we had to defend Mesut more.
Yet he does not see grounds for Özil to return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an additional integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says: The issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB President again next year.
I do my work and take care I do it as well as possible, Grindel said.
Elderly creates three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Roedental - As reported by the police, on Friday between the hours of 10 and 13, the 75 year old caused the accidents.
First, the 75 year old driver spoke with a lady at the red traffic light in the area of the Lauterer Höhe.
She informed the senior citizen that he had driven against her car.
No exchange of personal data occured as the 75 year old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later the police received a report by phone about an automobile driver who had come off the road and driven into a reflector post.
When asked, the man did not want the police on the scene and then drove off.
Afterwards the Rödental native drove home.
However, the retiree in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, got lost and while making a turn rammed a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car showed clear signs of damage from accidents.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not recall much.
The damages amounted to approx. 1 300 Euros.
Moorland Fire in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 forces on site.
About four weeks after the outbreak of moorland fires on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency forces are still busy with firefighting operations.
The federal armed forces announced this on Sunday.
70 volunteers were recently withdrawn since, according to a spokesman, the situation continues to be stable.
Also it was reported, that a further withdrawal of emergency forces is planned.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the state of emergency was lifted, which had been proclaimed a week earlier on September 21th, because it had been feared that the flames would spread by wind and flying sparks and thus endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
On thursday, it was reported that there is no longer a threat of the fire spreading to adjacent communities.
At times more than 1,500 deployment forces on site attempted to get the big fire under control.
The German Air Force used a transport helicopter to support the work on the German Federal Armed Forces test site near Meppen.
There are also reconnaissance flights with the Bundeswehr's drones.
According to the German Federal Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with “Tornadoes” are again planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was caused by test rockets, which the Airbus technicians had fired off.
The smoke draught of the moorland fires went up to a hundred kilometers far, even farther than the northwest of Germany, up to Bremen at times.
On Monday, the German Federal Armed Forces wants to set up a contact center to receive damage reports.
The first damage claims have already been announced by hoteliers and vacation home owners.
SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after marriage became available for everyone, the politician has married his longtime boyfriend in Hamburg.
The two have been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the “Bild” newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the fiscal policy speaker for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 2017 Kahrs caused a huge stir about the opening of marriage to homosexuals in the Bundestag debate.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Before this they were able to register their civil partnership from 2001, but there was no equality in terms of marriage and the right to adopt.
Referendum over a new state name has begun in Macedonia
In Macedonia the eagerly anticipated referendum for a new name for this small Balkan state, has started.
About 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in future.
Neighboring Greece insists that it should due its eponymous northern province.
As a lever, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the starting signal for their country's integration into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the holocaust from oblivion
Holocaust survivor, Elie Wiesel, would have been 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in 2016 in the USA and leaves a work behind, which will preserve the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland is starting an electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent.
(dpa) Switzerland starts its electronic register for organ donation this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Those who want to donate their organs in cases of death, can register themselves.
Your wishes will then be available to Swisstransplant, if required.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent, as is the case in Germany.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have donor cards, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment when donating is possible.
In over 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the dead person’s intentions.
You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, according to their wish, which is often very stressful, says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, the recording of details about possible organ donation on the health card has been considered, as stated by the speaker for the Federal Office for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
There is no register where people can record their wishes, for or against organ donation, she says.
Federal Health Minister has spoken about new guidelines for organ donation.
According to his suggestion, everyone will be considered an organ donor, unless he/she or relatives contradict this.
Among others, the Catholic Church objects the proposed regulation.
14-year-old pupil is a world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old pupil Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in mental arithmetic.
On the weekend he defeated 39 competitors in Wolfsburg.
On Sunday the announcement was made by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest world champion participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese pupil, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as reported by head judge Ralf Laue.
Every two years the competition is organised by the computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony).
Examples of previous tasks included are: 14 130 214 x 17 981 822 or 57 809 355 + 28 x 16 448 333.
On Saturday afternoon there was a show where competitors competed against guests with calculators among the audience as spectators are not allowed to watch the competition.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he can keep a ball in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries, tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago Grüß as a 14 year old, at the time, was present in Bielefeld.
With terms like super brain, genius or prodigy, the organiser Laue can do little with.
It is possible to train in mental arithmetic, he said.
Many participants trained several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computing competitions set up in stadiums.
Square root extraction from six-digit numbers, for example, is also included in the disciplines.
In the various calculations, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they need to find a solution strategy.
The main judge said the Germans also had a good chance.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage as already in early childhood mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It’s all about early detection of breast cancer
Tennis star Serena Williams shows her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and speak up for its early diagnosing.
It is about life and death, but also courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up the song "I Touch Myself" of the group "The Divinyls" topless with only hands covering her most intimate parts.
The singer, Chrissy Amphlett, died because of it.
The emotional video is part of the ‘I Touch Myself’ project, about how the early recognition of breast cancer, can save lives.
Serena Williams herself could have died a year ago.
There were some complications when she was giving birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia.
To save the baby’s life an emergency surgery was started.
In a subsequent CT in Serena’s lung were discovered blood clots.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to extend the ban on using extremist symbols.
Next week the turquoise blue coalition is sending a relevant draft legislation on the so-called “Symbol Law" for appraisal.
As a result, there will be an obvious increase in the number of terrorist or comparable groups, caught by this ban.
Cold polar air is bringing fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will be shaking out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Cold polar air will reach the Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg regions on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow fall limit sinks to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - it was reported, that in narrow valleys, there might be intense snowfalls to about 1,000 meters.
20 to 40 cm of fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 meters from the Bregenz Forest to the High Tauern mountain range.
Therefore, road conditions on higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) may be wintry.
On Monday farmers are allowed to start the annual hedge bank maintainance
On Monday Schleswig-Holstein farmers can start with the annual hedge bank maintainance.
For around 200 years, the "green ramparts" which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘forest replacements’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas of retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedge banks are living fences
In the year 1766 the hedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The ‘living fences’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fencing, they also provided farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time comes the name "Knick": By "bending over" (Umknicken) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU’s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habitat.
One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there.
The hedge banks can only fulfill their ecologically important role if they are maintained accordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stunted to a sparse tree line, which causes not only losses in biodiversity but also in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedge bank maintenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, can only take place outside the breeding period or from October until March.
After the tsunami on Sulawesi an Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the local situation on Sulawesi island following the earthquakes and tsunami in the interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND):
Were you on location when the tsunami took place?
No, I was in Jakarta on Java island at the time.
At the time of the earthquakes, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive for more than 20 hours by car after the flight as the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again, so aid supply can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which were completely destroyed.
Our ‘World Vision’ office is also destroyed, but we have set something up provisionally, where other people have also been accommodated.
Where are the people of Sulawesi living now?
Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they held out through fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where there is no access to water and food.
Many stopped in front of their houses with aftershocks still being experienced.
As many food shops and gas stations are completely shut, some people are stealing provisions and gasoline.
The public services have completely shut down and the national government is helping.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and searching for them is difficult.
There are still lots of bodies lying around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information flow on the island?
At the moment we have mobile reception, which did not work previously and we have been receiving information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other persons, not knowing if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquake and were on the way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work correctly.
Do you have any information about this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear was given, many people thought ‘OK, no tsunami’, and then it came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was false information about a tsunami hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding hills.
An island like Sulawesi that sits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared for earthquakes?
Yet there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We normally know how to react to an earthquake and are trained for evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries to Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missed for a long time in the VfB Stuttgart's line-up due to serious muscle injuries.
Aogo tore a muscle fiber in his rear left thigh during a 2:1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer team announced on Sunday.
Donis was diagnosed with a torn muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably also miss matches after the international cap break.
A downtime forecast was not given by VfB Stuttgart.
A torn muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a torn muscle fibre usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at San Sebástian film festival
San Sebastián - Each year, the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes the season of Europe’s most prestigious festivals.
Despite all the talk of cinema’s demise one can summarize: 2018 was a remarkable year for the movies.
After an impressive contest in Cannes, with particularly strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a festival in Venice, which attracted much attention for its Oscar hopefuls from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the operation took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning walkers along the Olchinger See noticed a white, injured duck.
It stopped in the area of the water safety station.
Passers-by called the police and fire department to help the animal.
The first attempts to catch the duck went wrong however.
Despite its injury, it continued to dodge the emergency services.
In the end the duck fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could circle the animal and push it back ashore, where after almost an hour it was then put in a transport box with a courageous grip by a firefighter.
The duck, with an injured breast, was then taken to the LMU’s animal hospital in Oberschleißheim.
However, initial assessments revealed that its chances of surviving were fairly low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for the World Championship medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was sad for a long time about fourth place at the Olympics.
In the coming winter, the Saalfelden native wants to catch up on the missed medal at the world championship in Östersund.
The 31 year old’s last shot cost him the medal that was within his grasp in the Olympic sprint at Pyeonchang.
Seven tenths of a second cost him the bronze in the end.
I deliberately gave myself time to process this, says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
My goal was to win a medal. I was in peak form, but it just wasn’t to be.
The Pinzgau region native is all the more motivated to catch up on the missed medal in the new season: "The goal can only be to go to a major event to win something.
At some point you have to win.
The world championship cross-country ski run in Östersund, Sweden is Eberhard's: “I have already taken the track to heart,” he says as he happily remembers his fourth place world cup finish in the individual race last year.
Right after the Olympics, he celebrated Austria’s only individual victory in the last world cup winter in the mass start competition in Kontiolahti, Finland.
In Oslo (NOR), he managed second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: High-speed FBI investigation
Time is extremely tight and the number of planned interrogations is very restricted.
Republicans in the US Senate want the break-neck speed FBI investigation to help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clarify more than 30 years of suspected incidents from years back.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination, which has involved a culture war, had been triggered on Friday.
After an 8-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer directed angry tirades at the opposition democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to pave the way for final confirmation of the ultra-sensitive judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake, against his original announcement, suddenly declared he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
Following tumultuous scenes his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described the bitter arguments on Thursday as a ‘scam’, then included further attacks against the women and spoke in contrast about a ‘blessing in disguise’.
He said that this way any lingering doubts could be eliminated.
Later, Trump attacked Democrats sharply at a rally because they opposed Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump is ordering an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely narrowed the powers of the investigators.
They will focus on investigating the known allegations by two women, nothing more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They will not be going on a fishing trip."
According to the ‘New York Times’ only four witnesses will be heard.
As of Monday October 1st the mobile radar unit installed in a "civil vehicle", that keeps watch over speed limits in the borough of Ried was located to the Gartenstraße, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality has been operating multiple permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after defeating Mainz: You could feel the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
There is a great sense of relief at Schalke after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, time was also a factor against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Heidel is well-known for being a huge pessimist at football matches.
The home game against Mainz 05 was no different.
I saw every ball going in.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the "royal blues" had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the course of the match and thus celebrated the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have been very different.
After Alessandro Schöpf (11th) had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and therefore security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both in terms of how we played and in terms of pressing". As the match continued, mental strength became increasingly important.
Schöpf is usually not an aerial threat
The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me, said Heidel: ‘I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench’.
The boys were afraid to squander the lead and therefore kept retreating.
And threw everything they had into our defense.
To hold on to the first three points of the season.
We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am actually the worst header on the team."
But in the end, victory is all that counts.
The relief was felt throughout the entire arena, not least by Tedesco.
We wanted to start strong in the early stages and make a firework of it, said Schalke’s head coach.
The win was an important one.
Finally we can enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, calmly and with courage, that is how we must approach matches over 90 minutes
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: The "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish control over the match early.
After all, they did get their chances, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would not have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Tedesco: "You really could feel the fear a little bit."
So I am glad that we won.
He was not the only one at Schalke.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal visible from 2 km
The smoke was hard to miss.
On Sunday at around 13.30, at a distance of approximately two kilometres a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire.
The police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and fire departments: A stranger had set fire to garbage on a two square meter area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appears the fire was monitored for a long time, but the embers were inadvertently left behind.
Close to the forest too.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were tasked with dispersing and extinguishing it.
The police now think it is a case of arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani is standing before them.
He has once again accepted the invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
For many year, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven, explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he introduces the audience to one of the most contentious topics: Migration and integration.
Why are there increasingly conflicts, despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
The German society sits at the big table, the migrants of the first generation at the kid’s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany. They always sat at the big table and now want to have a say too.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not of importance whether one is politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then the discussion round gets more and more lively.
And there is a need for discussion.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, and two teachers explain how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front of the stage, not on it, symbolizing the discussion: It is a discussion at eye level.
The sociology professor does not force his opinion onto the audience, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is happy that people are interested in the topic, because “we can only find a solution once we understand what the problem is,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the guests’ questions and the discussion continued in the foyer over Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers und the Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first match day of Bundesliga Basketball (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen won through in a very competitive game on its own court scoring 91:84 (43:46) against Mitteldeutscher BC.
The ambitious team from Bonn won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
Alba Berlin are the fist team at the top of the table this season after their 112: 55 thumping on Saturday of Science City Jena.
German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg, by contrast, had more of an uphill battle at the beginning of the new season.
Munich fought to a hard-won 83:77 on Friday at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the "Frankenderby" on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in South Landsham.
The Pliening community sold the first properties in the South Landsham development area on the open market.
This was reported by the mayor Roland Frick.
Anyway the application phase for each of the 20 properties, which the municipality is offering at better conditions and prices - similar to the earlier local model, has now ended.
At least 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
At present, the documents are being reviewed with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal by the end of the year is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots of land ready for submission to the local council.
After that the awarding of the plots can follow.
In the area to the south of Landsham a total of 50 single-family and semi-detached properties will be created, including four areas for apartment blocks earmarked for eight residential units.
The development is practically completed, only the streets and pathways now need to be asphalted.
A single plot and two for apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
The municipality sells the bulk of the plots on the open market, 20 plots according to the socially responsible model.
The two multi-family houses of the borough are to be built according to Frick as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented flats subsidised by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated, there will be space for about 200 people within the properties of the developing area of Landsham-Süd.
Not only this: At the start of October, Frick says the new construction of a daycare center will begin.
This will accommodate three kindergarten and three toddler groups, including a multipurpose room.
The opening is planned for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This way, Schalke player Naldo is also a great athlete on the bench
Not in the starting lineup for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues has not been in the Schalke starting line-up for the third time in a row, many people would have understood it if the almost two-meters-tall Brazilian player had got his frustration off his chest.
But when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 in the center circle as usual and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his players, the 36-year-old nicknamed Naldo stepped in and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
That was very emotional, he is such a great sport, Tedesco said later about the reaction of his vice-captain, who holds no grudge despite his seat on the bench.
Naldo, who was awarded best Schalke player last season, probably knows that he is actually not going to be stuck on the bench - he does have a good reason for this break.
A reason called “load control.”
It was not easy to tell him
It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important player. He is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” said Tedesco as he justifies the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can catch their breath at the moment.
And that we keep everyone together, said Tedesco explaining the rotation, which has recently hit Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted wisely: by proving himself as a model team player on the bench.
Compared to the rest of the euro zone, the descending mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate further in August.
The purchasing managers index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe after Ireland and the Netherlands, stated the Markit Institute on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, putting the index below the growth indicating 50-counter mark for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fell more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
However, the slightly eased downswing could mean that the worst is over, said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders to the eurozone have not fallen this much since November 2011.
That is why companies have cut back jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China in August fell more strongly than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The PMI figures are based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in terms of turnover, employment, warehousing and prices are recorded.
Tuchel's PSG team successfully got the eighth victory in the eighth game of the league
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nizza - At football championship in France coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nizza, the defending champion, won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two the goals by the superstar Neymar and won the eighth game of the league.

Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire was put out at a chemical plant considered to be particularly hazardous and located in the northern French city of Rouen. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out Thursday night. No one was injured during the incident. The fire department deployed around 200 fire engines.
They were able to control the fire.
Residents had been requested not to leave their homes. Buildings in a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine manufactures additives for lubricants. The plant belongs to the company Lubrizol owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which stipulates particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical plant has made headlines in the past, for example in 2013 when methane thiol escaped through a leak and the entire area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewer system following an industrial accident.
Woman Quits Her Job to Search for her Lost Dog for 57 Days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her lost dog—and she quit her job to do it. The seven-year-old border collie took off out of a hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. There was no sign of the dog for 57 days, but Carole King wouldn't give up.
"It was dreadful. It made me ill," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left the dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They looked for their pet in vain.
Thunder had Frightened the Dog
Hoping that Katie was still somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception desk. "The employee said, ‘She took off around four to four-and-a-half hours ago,'" Carole King remembered when talking to the "Daily Inter Lake." Katie had run out when the automatic entry door opened. Loud thunder had presumably caused the dog to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake," and quite her job as a postal worker to continue looking for Katie.
"The Tears Flowed"
Fifty-seven days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call. A man answered and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already run off again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly saw her dog standing under a tree. "I embraced her. I never wanted to let go," King remembered, according to the "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped their cars, got out, and hugged us. I believe the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses for the German Army: Machine Guns Disappear Without a Trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the German Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and ten thousand rounds of ammunition. These include three machine guns. In most cases, their whereabouts are unclear. According to the opposition, this is an "alarming" extent.
The German Army is continuing to lose weapons and ammunition, often without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the armed forces has registered a loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon components, and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is revealed in a classified listing of the German Ministry of Defense on which the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) ("Editor Network Germany") has reported.
According to the paper from the office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon component, and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have resurfaced so far. The weapons and weapon components that are still missing include six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols, and two P8 pistols. And 30 MG3 machine gun barrels are missing.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition by the German Army is "alarming," said Martina Renner, a member of the Left party in the Bundestag. This is all the more true since hardly anything was found during the investigations. The politician from the Left party spoke of a "poor balance sheet." Renner criticized the fact that the listing did not make clear whether the disappeared ammunition included that which was found in connection with the investigations against the German Army officer Franco A., who is suspected of terrorism. "And this, although a supporter of Franco A. was recently sentenced for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
‘Stena Impero' Oil Tanker left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker ‘Stena Impero' has left the port in the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As Refinitiv ship observation data showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was given as the destination port.
In practice, the tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, though it remained in Iranian waters for a time. The speech indicated that an official notification from Tehran was preferred.
On the 19th July, the ‘Stena Impero' had been accused by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Hormuz Strait of violating safety regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker by British run Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important Straits in the world. In connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's global oil exports are shipped through this strait. The tensions in the area had been escalating immeasurably during the past few months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel hails people's courage in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the engagement of people in the GDR who took to the streets in the Peaceful Revolution 30 years ago. In the fall of 1989 courageous citizens toppled the East German regime, said Merkel at a ceremony held by the Thuringian branch of the CDU party in Erfurt marking the forthcoming Day of German Unity. The chancellor recalled events such as the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The State Security police were deprived of their terror," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Tesla's quarter may be record-breaking. Despite the boom in deliveries, the electric car company has seen losses recently.
New York. Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the opportunity to reach 100,000 deliveries in our first quarter," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
Demand is so strong that Tesla was able to record 110000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge is getting the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to mobilize as many resources as possible at quarter-end.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares closed the day with a gain of over six percent. The price has not increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered around 95,000 cars and hit its best value to date.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. The company would have to hit six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter to do so. The less expensive Tesla Model 3 is in particular demand, but its profit margins are low. There have been losses recently despite the boom.
Puzzle solved: This is why we cannot tickle ourselves
There is a sort of a stopping brake in our cerebrum, preventing us from tickling ourselves. This was discovered by scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin after conducting experiments on rats, as reported on Thursday. Progress was also made in answering the question as to why children resist tickling, only to ask for more later.
It was also determined why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter ever before contact. The reason can be found in a deep layer of the cerebrum which triggers laughter even through only expectation of tickling.
According to the data, previous research has shown that rats react by "laughing" in the ultrasonic range when tickled by humans. This "laughter" travels through the part of the cerebral cortex, which is used for the central processing of haptic perception.
The laughter is suppressed when the touch originates from the person themselves.
Until now, it was assumed that the brain is able to tell the difference between the touch originating from oneself, as opposed to from others, which would explain why people cannot tickle themselves. The researchers from Berlin have now discovered, from their experiments on rats that laughter and the activity of the cerebral cortex is suppressed during self-touching. This is also true when animals clean themselves. However, when the touching and tickling was done by the scientists, the brain activities as well as the impulse to laugh increased.
And, if the self-touching and touching by another were to occur at the same time, the laughter is suppressed anyway. This indicated that the rat´s brain could not determine whether the touch came from itself or the scientists. The new findings explained that humans cannot tickle themselves because tickling triggers a stopping brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were taught to tickle themselves. They sometimes stopped this activity prematurely, displaying flight behavior or paralysis. This ambivalence is similar to the way children behave. The tickle ambivalence is a behavioral reaction that is found in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: Major fire at French chemical plant extinguished
The large fire was put out at a chemical plant considered to be particularly hazardous and located in the northern French city of Rouen. The prefecture of Normandy reported the incident to the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out Thursday night.
According to information from officials, no hazardous material has escaped. The samples taken show no reason for alarm, said prefect Pierre-André Durand at a press conference Friday morning. No one was injured during the incident. The fire department deployed around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens were closed.
Residents were asked not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 1,650 feet were evacuated, and schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Plant belongs to the company Lubrizol owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine manufactures additives for lubricants. The plant belongs to the company Lubrizol owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's "Seveso Directive", which stipulates particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work at the plant.
The chemical plant has made headlines in the past—as in 2013, when methanethiol escaped via a leak and the entire area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 440 gallons of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewer system following an industrial accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by own sister
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's sister commented on his speech at the first session of Parliament after the forced shutdown was lifted on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatened to lead the country out of the EU without an agreement on October 31 should Brussels not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he wants to achieve that is yet unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had worked to keep Britain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and bring this country together would be to get Brexit done." Cox was murdered in 2016 by a right-wing extremist during the referendum vote.
A monument to attacks in Oslo and Utöya is unveiled
More than eight years after attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deceased a memorial is unveiled in Norway on Saturday to honor the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (English: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They are reminiscent of the roses which thousands of people brought to the Oslo Cathedral in the days and weeks after the attacks.
The project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled in the same place—the roses were forged by people from all round the world, among them survivors and dependents of the victims. Prince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marit are expected to be present, amongst others, for the unveiling.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had detonated a bomb in the Oslo government district on July 22nd, 2011, and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp on the Island of Utöya of a youth organization for the social democratic workers' party. In total 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tanker
The UN General Assembly debate brought no solution in the Iran conflict. However, there is now one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero," which had been held in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's plan for peace.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero," which had been impounded in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" left the harbor of Bandar Abbas, and the crew is now travelling to Dubai for medical exams, among other reasons, said the shipping company's CEO Erik Hånell. The ship left Iranian waters around noon. "It's great that this is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The foreign ministry in London described the detainment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain ship travel and international law," they announced on Friday.
The Iranian revolutionary guards impounded the tanker on July 19 under the pretext that it had violated maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members were already released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well under the circumstances, said Hånell. For the past ten weeks they have conducted themselves professionally in light of the difficult and grueling situation. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspects that behind the impounding of the "Stena Impero" is a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: There, a supertanker with oil from Iran that was supposedly destined for Syria was detained at the beginning of July. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the warring nation of Syria. The British were notified about the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened that there would be consequences. The "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released in mid-August. London vehemently denied speculations that it was an exchange deal to get the "Stena Impero" released.
The Straits of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. In connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's global oil exports are shipped through this strait. The tensions in the area had been escalating immeasurably during the past few months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tension between Teheran and Washington was the atomic conflict of the two nations. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies this. In 2018, the USA exited the international nuclear arms treaty that was to prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has pressured the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a treaty that is stricter and expanded to other territories. So far, Iran has withstood that pressure.
Due to the dispute surrounding the "Stena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the USA is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
During the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz. With the initiative "coalition of hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wishes to ensure the security of ship travel in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, without foreign protective powers.
India Builds a Better Future with its Protectionist Economic Policy
India really was predestined to be the "war profiteer." In light of the punitive tariffs imposed by the American President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to make new arrangements. In a UBS survey, CFOs of Asian firms that are considering relocating their production outside China name India as one of the best alternatives. And surely this involves more than the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems ideally situated to play a more significant role in the global, widespread production chain.
But now Trump is focusing on India itself. Pejoratively called the "Kingdom of the tariffs" by warhorses in the White House, America withdrew trade incentives for 2000 products from the newly industrialized country at the beginning of June. The USA is charging India prohibitively higher tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of the trade war, the friction with India is little more than a sideshow. Moreover, America sees the world's largest democracy through the lens of a security policy. Delhi and Washington are united in their concern over China's claims to power in the southern Indian Ocean. This makes a volley of American tariffs against India appear unlikely. So India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just entered his second five-year term, can feel safe.
But the problem lies elsewhere: The (empirically corroborated) proposition that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist republic of India. Including under Modi. His zeal for reform mainly targets the bureaucratic insanity that suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the ethnically diverse country for far too long. Companies now obtain construction permits for buildings much faster. They profit from a better energy and traffic infrastructure, and a concise insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for more rapid liquidation of companies with high debt that appear on their last legs.
The success of these efforts is apparent and can be measured in the pertinent rankings. From an economic standpoint, much in India took a turn for the better during Modi's first five years. But its trade policy did not. Eager to keep foreign suppliers from threatening companies with little international competitiveness, the national government has even set up new barriers.
In the West, Modi wears a halo of the energetic reformer who radically regenerated his country's economy. This impression exists not least because the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary pleases Western managers. Essentially, the "India First" advocate never wavers from a protectionist economic policy that keeps Indian companies from having to dispense with old-fashioned processes, although doing so would make them fit for global competition. Merchants that survive thanks to the isolation of their industries make up the core voters of Modi's nationalistic Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Jacques Chirac to be Buried in Paris on Monday
The former President of France, Jacques Chirac, will reportedly be buried in Paris during the coming weeks. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in Montparnasse Cemetery to the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported in reference to the Chirac family. The burial will take place within an intimate family circle. According to media reports, a public funeral in the Dôme des Invalides was set for Sunday.
The competitors made it to the finish line. Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships.
His world title was already in sight, when heartwarming scenes played themselves out in Khalifa International Stadium. In the men's first 5000-meter run, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to stagger dangerously. A good 300 meters before the finish line he was barely able to stay on his feet, walking in an unhealthy hunched posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the west African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly linked arms with him and supported him for the last half round of the stadium to the finish line. After crossing the finish line, they both still had the strength to stop their moving wristwatch. As if the scene was not strange enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after running in a mixed zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. First, he shyly evaded any mention of his heroic act. After all, he did try to set out his personal best and when he noticed, that this would be difficult, he decided just to support his fellow sufferer. In any case, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Championships by the World association. Under normal circumstances he would not even have been allowed to start. "For this reason I am proud to walk for my country," he said.
He did this empathically on the evening—and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this hero act will remain in public memory. Especially since Dabo gave his competitor Busby the finish line and volunteered for last place—a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary run. In the end, it was all of no use, because Busby who had been escorted to the finish line with a lot of propping up was disqualified precisely for that reason by the World Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best at the World Championships in Doha. He succeeded in this with 18:10,87 minutes, which disappointed him. "I wanted to walk in 17:55 minutes. I had already reached under 18 minutes previously. But only in training, where best times don't count.
March of millions: Egyptians get ready for wild day of protest
Security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible anti-regime protests in Egypt. An increased police presence was observed in the center of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations were closed and streets around the centrally located Tahrir Square were blocked off.
In the last few days, police had already increased road checks and searched the cell phones of passersby for messages and photos connected with the protests. Hundreds have been arrested, according to two non-government organizations.
Opponents of El-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests involving hundreds and thousands of people in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura. These were aimed against the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has been accused of corruption and mismanagement by critics. There has not been such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian property developer and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain, triggered the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook and appealed for millions to march at central locations in the country this Friday. Ali is calling for a "people's revolution." To most young Egyptians, he is probably not considered one of the "good ones", as he raked in millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are catching on.
The number of people arrested in connection with the protests continued to increase, according to two watch groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more than 2,000 arrests. These figures have not yet been independently confirmed. The government did not confirm or comment on the numbers.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arrested arbitrarily just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," said HRW, citing the lawyers of detainees. According to their attorneys, accusations against those arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership of a "terrorist organization." In Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities, security forces, in uniform as well as civilian clothing, also arbitrarily questioned and searched passersby, according to HRW.
HRW also criticized the censorship in this North African country. It said the government in Cairo is blocking websites and social media in order to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: E-commerce companies should be able to donate returns more easily
To online retailers, many packages that are sent back are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has provided online retailers like Amazon and Zalando with a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Companies will still have to pay the value -added tax on material donations, explained the Ministry in response to a question from Green Party members of the German parliament which was reported in newspapers from the Funke Media Group on Friday. However, retailers could understate the market value of unsaleable returns so that they would be required to pay little or no value-added tax.
Researchers from the University of Bamberg have determined that German shoppers return one in six online orders. Around four percent of these items—around 20 million products—then end up in the garbage. Under the current legal framework, it would cost companies additional money to donate them because financial authorities consider material donations to be a sale subject to value-added tax.
Green Party leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by decree that companies are permitted to value unsaleable products appropriately and donate them to charitable organizations. Companies must be assured that they will not be penalized for making donations. This applies to online retail as well as other businesses such as fashion outlets and home improvement stores.
Banksy Art to be Auctioned: There has Never Been a Better Time to Sell This Painting
The famous work of street art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into tribalistic animalistic behavior." Starting on Saturday, the painting is to be shown at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is sold on October 3. It is estimated to be worth 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first shown in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in southwest Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist showed the painting again—on the original Brexit date of March 29. For this occasion, the work, which was first entitled "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament."
The painting could change hands for a sum in the millions.
Recently, at the first session of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson exchanged blows with the opposition after a mandatory break he had imposed was repealed by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out Brexit (which has already been postponed twice) on October 31: without a treaty with the EU if necessary.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity remains a secret, has gotten involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in southeast England, he painted a picture showing a man breaking a star of the European flag to pieces with a chisel. Every day, thousands of automobile drivers and other visitors see that work when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson against Brexit opponents in parliament did not contribute to a climate of hatred, his top advisor believes. Compared to the election before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings at a book launch on Friday. "We are enjoying this. We are going to leave [the EU] and we are going to win."
In recent days, Johnson has vehemently attacked Brexit opponents in parliament and accused them of "betraying" the people, among other things. He dismissed as "humbug" accusations that he could be putting members of parliament in danger because they could then become the target of death threats.
Cummings said that the only way for calm to return would be if members of parliament decide to finally respect the British people's decision to leave the EU. It should come as no surprise that people are upset that Great Britain still has not exited the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to others with respect. And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan demands UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal to the UN, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise another war between the Pakistan and India, both nuclear powers, is likely, Khan stated on Friday during the UN general debate in New York. "When things are bad, one can hope for the best, but should be prepared for the worst". The UN had a responsibility towards Kashmir. "You should have prevented this".
India and Pakistan have been involved in three wars since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947, and two of those wars were waged over the divided Kashmir region. Both countries with nuclear powers control a part of Kashmir and the third part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India revoked the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region, and sharply increased tensions in its relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President el-Sisi.
The government is cracking down on the recent protests in Egypt. It permitted the use of live ammunition against the population, and more than 2000 people were arrested, joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in jail. Protesting in Egypt has never been without danger. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything in its power to prevent a scenario like the Arab Spring.
One of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness, and the feeling of being stifled by their own government drove millions onto the streets. And that is one problem that the regime of el-Sisi cannot handle, no matter how hard they move against their opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, one third of Egyptian citizens live below the poverty line. Since 2016, Egypt's currency has lost more than half of its value, and the inflation rate has climbed to 10 percent. Anyone who wants to purchase a bottle of water at the supermarket must decide who they want to finance: Nestlé, Coca Cola, or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but is also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, and soccer stadiums, produces food, and much more. That was also the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a great deal of experience with authoritative regimes, and the situation in the supermarket is nothing new. Things always become critical when large segments of the population struggle to buy even a bottle of water.
Tüv testing in the Terminal: BER boss: No more ‘showstoppers' for main city airports
For two months there were tests to see whether the complicated plant network at BER Fire Protection works interactively. The operators are satisfied with the progress. But the Tüv is not finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the Terminal of the future metropolitan airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October of next year. This is certain, said supervisory board chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke about a successfully completed examination, but also said there are still defects to be worked through in the Terminal. "We have a lot of detail topics, but we do not have a real showstopper." He reassured us that before the launch there are still some buffers.
However, there are indications, that it will not take much longer to complete. The construction completion notice is to be submitted to the building authority during the first quarter of 2020, at the start of the year it had been predicted for this autumn.
Hundreds of power cable defects still need addressing; the Tüv wants to check all of these by February. "In order to create prognoses for the acceptance of flight operations, there has to continue to be intensive work on the defects," the written communication stated.
Lütke Daldrup said, that in many cases it's a matter of missing verification rather than new cables. There has also not been release for all dowelling on which the cables hang. The airport manager is expecting this to be available at the end of the year.
Also, the fire protection at the passage to the station under the Terminal is not satisfactory yet. There had already been problems leading the project into further crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoke barriers, which descend like a canvas during a fire, so that smoke does not spread. They go too far down. Therefore, 36 engines have to be exchanged. There will be new testing with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further building defects such as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was meant to become operational in 2011. Since building started in 2006, the costs have risen by two billion to an expected approximation of 6.5 billion Euro for opening next year.
Because the amounts of passengers in Berlin have risen noticeably since then, those responsible are planning an expansion of the airport. For this reason, there is a special meeting of the supervisory board planned on October 18th, the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new business directors. Finance boss Heike Fölster is changing to Deutschen Bahn next year, Personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider informed us. He thanked Fölster. She put airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Police arrest man for blowing up vending machines to get drugs
He needed money for drugs—so he blew up a load of vending machines in Chemnitz! Now the culprit is behind bars.
The number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region increased drastically over the past two years. Millions of euros' worth of damage was caused.
The police arrested a 33-year-old German following two detonations in Bürgerstrasse and Further Strasse in Chemnitz at the end of May.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations by Chemnitz Criminal Investigation Department into explosions in conjunction with a particularly serious case of theft, this is not the only suspicion related to the 33-year-old that was confirmed".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitz resident has confessed to a total of eight offenses.
Said the police spokesman: "He evidently funded his drug habit with the proceeds." The bomber detonated parking ticket machines in Bürgerstrasse four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The damage caused amounts to at least EUR 60,000!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody awaiting trial. The police investigations into him are continuing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for blowing up further vending machines in Chemnitz and surrounding areas.
AUA Takes Over Eurowings Flights From Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is radically changing its strategy for the Vienna Airport. Amid the price war with budget airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet, and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking on "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights leaving Vienna," a press officer from Austrian Airlines confirmed to the APA on Friday. "AviationNetOnline" had made previous reports to that end.
This will de facto dissolve the Vienna base of the Lufthansa budget airline Eurowings. Of the seven Eurowings flights currently existing, four will remain in Vienna. Beginning in January 2020, the AUA will take these over in a "wet lease," which includes Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck to vacation destinations as chartered planes. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Deutschland.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the office explained. The flight times will be coordinated with those of connecting flights. The goal is to strengthen the hub in Vienna and expand the decentralized traffic from the federal provinces.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna still serves only as a "production company" for its sister company AUA. For example, Barcelona, Rome, and other cities would be served with an AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings machines. Although the board product will be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants will come from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight numbers will reportedly no longer begin in Terminal 1, but in Terminal 3 like the AUA.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a price war has broken out at the Vienna Airport. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase its fleet in Vienna to sixteen airplanes next summer. To that end, the Irish budget airline is sending four Ryanair planes and crews to Vienna; this will also be done through a wet lease, which has been criticized by the trade union as a construct for bypassing the collective agreement.
The challenge laid down by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary—that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years—was countered on Friday by Andreas Otto, the CCO of AUA: "We will remain number one at that location after five, six, or ten years."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William, and Harry: These cousins were best friends as children. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: On their trip to Italy at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have asked his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) for her hand in marriage. This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement. We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can't wait to be married," the couple officially announced, having been together since October 2018 according to British media reports.
They continued: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie snapped the photos
Her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), took the official engagement photos, and also published them on her Instagram account.
A royal celebration
The marriage is set to take place in 2020. The palace will announce more detailed information on the date, location, and everything else in the coming months.
One thing is certain, however: The wedding of the ninth in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a celebration as large as Eugenie's marriage to Jack Brooksbank (33) on October 12, 2018.
Study on the causes of heart diseases
Smoking, being overweight, unhealthy diet—there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what actually triggers heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a precise look at the DNA of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the DNA of 9,000 people, researchers from Hamburg and Switzerland are attempting to find out exactly what causes cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, announced the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is supporting the initiative with €12.5 million. In Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos Hospital, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital of Zurich are participating.
Being overweight, smoking, and an unhealthy diet are among the key influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors also contribute to the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is not yet sufficiently understood, they say. Researchers now want to compare the entire DNA of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of almost 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause DNA changes—called mutations—that lead to heart disease, according to the clinic. Approximately 200 are added each year.
Those behind this five-year project say its goal is to develop new options for preventing, detecting, and treating cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest. The data could also be of use when researching other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, Director of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings may be made on the interaction between the heart and brain, the heart and nerves, as well as cancers.
Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm intention to use the data to study other diseases also. The foundation's clinic in Davos has primarily treated allergies to date. The medical campus there will now include a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and employ a professor of bioinformatics. Explaining his commitment to the project, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had open-heart surgery three years ago in Hamburg and is very grateful.
The biomaterial of healthy participants comes from citizens of Hamburg who were also taking part in the Hamburg City Health Study. At 45,000 test subjects, this is the largest local healthy study in the world, according to information from the clinic. Researchers affirmed that the protection of anonymous data would be strictly ensured when deciphering the DNA. There will be a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital of Zurich.
Today, a person's DNA can be deciphered within 24 hours, according to UKE. The purely material costs for this amount to €1,300. The first genetic sequencing in the world, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred millions of euros. The study is set to begin on October 1, and all 9,000 subjects are to be analyzed by the end of 2020. The initial results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police frees hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 mistreated and abused boys from a Quran school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the town of Kaduna in northern Nigeria and discovered the victims, some of whom were still minors, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were mistreated. Several of them claimed to have been raped by teachers", stated Sabo.
The boys had been held captive under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Quran. In actual fact, the students were imprisoned by their teachers in "the most degrading and subhuman conditions", said Sabo. Around a hundred students, including nine year old children were chained up in a small room.
According to the statements, the Quran school existed for about ten years. The residents had repeatedly pointed out incidents in the institution to the authorities. The parents were shocked as they learned of the state of the Quran school, stated Sabo. They had no knowledge of the suffering their children were being put through. The manager and six employees were arrested, according to the police.
There are many private Quran schools in the predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria. They often replace the insufficient state institutions. The people of the region are often subjected to attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring country of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police releases 400 children from school
Police in a school in the north of Nigeria have freed almost 400 students from horrific circumstances. "Many of them were chained up and had visible injuries indicating torture," said police representative Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
After a tip-off, Children had been discovered in an Islamic school on Thursday. The conditions there are said to have been "inhuman." The employees arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the rescue mission.
The children, all of them boys, had been kept like slaves and put in chains. Some of them had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a recognizably bad health condition.
The Best FIFA Football Awards: More reproaches after Messi´s and Klopp´s freestyle
Soccer "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe honored
At a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa honors the best male and female player, and the best coach of the year. This is Messi´s sixth award and a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in The Best FIFA Football Awards, reproaches are reaching FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not rated at all—due to a curious reason.
There were several objectionable points at Fifa in recent years: the World Cup awards, president Gianni Infantino´s dubious plans, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. So far, however, The Best FIFA Football Awards have not been suspected of being unfair—apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to likeability rather than voting objectively.
But further inconsistencies are now emerging after Nicaragua's captain had expressed that he had not voted at all: Egypt claims that the votes by national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they did not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
Fifa apologized with the statement that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation, but so far no reply has been received.
Sudan´s Coach is also surprised
There has also been an outcry from Sudan regarding the awards. While the situation is understandable in Egypt's case, the Sudanese association claims that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote the way it was ultimately scored: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Mané in third. According to Fifa, however, this was the submitted vote, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "I haven´t voted in the #TheBest2019 Awards. All entries on my vote are untrue, thank you", he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association had simply voted on his behalf.
The association sent out a message on Friday: This is true, but it was of, course, not done on purpose. The completed documents were "mistakenly" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the association. The person who actually voted was the second captain, Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," the message said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi,however, "just as the official FIFA list indicates".
Fifa is now investigating the other cases, but stresses that the process was supervised externally by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Until then, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of The Best FIFA Football Awards—and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
The Ukraine scandal: High-ranking Republicans support official investigation
Two high-ranking republicans have spoken out in support of an investigation against the US President and party member Donald Trump. "I believe the investigation is important", stated the republican governor of Vermont Phil Scott. "Where the investigation goes from here will be determined by the established facts". He wanted to know more about scandal before taking any action. The impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the President from office.
Scott stated he was not surprised by the discoveries. It was revealed that during the telephone call, Trump had repeatedly urged the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott stated that Trump had been watching Biden "for years".
The republicans have so far withheld their criticism of Trump regarding the whistleblower scandal and only a few expressed concern. Scott's statements are the first sign of these concerns within Trump's party. The moderate Governor of Virginia, has already pushed back against Trump's policy multiple times, such as when he opposed loosening environmental regulations and increasing immigration requirements.
Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, is another high-ranking republican who spoke out in favor of the investigation. "This is a deeply disturbing situation", said Baker. "It is the right course of action and the responsibility of Congress to investigate the situation and get to the bottom of it".
As governors, Scott and Baker have no right to formally participate in the proceedings against Trump, as the decision will be made by the Congress. Their statements therefore bear symbolic significance. Nevertheless, the first Republican Senators have expressed criticism regarding the situation. Mitt Romney, the Utah representative in the second chamber of Parliament, stated that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". In addition, the US media report the first internal rifts have appeared amongst the Republicans.
This scandal could result in the initiation of the impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have already announced an investigation. He was accused of abusing power for the purpose of gaining foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact schedule regarding the impeachment procedure. The Democrats could call for impeachment due to holding the majority in the House of Representatives. However, the decision regarding an actual removal from office would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans hold the majority. Therefore, such a procedure has low chances of success. To date, no US President has been removed from office through an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily who are alleged to have tortured and murdered people in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain, Carola Rackete (31), was arrested in June after she made an unpermitted stop in the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees on board. Following fierce protests and international criticism—including from Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen—her house arrest was lifted by Italian judges after just a few days.
There are now new serious allegations against Rackete. She may have helped the three men, who are accused of torture at Libyan refugee camps, enter Italy on the Sea Watch 3. The suspects were taken into custody at a reception center in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their torturers in Italy. "We cannot rule it out, but we have no precise information," said Sea Watch spokesman, Ruben Neugebauer, to German news agency dpa.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured, and even murdered people in the North African country. The suspects are Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and two Egyptians, Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to cruelty through repeated and continual physical violence," they said in the statement.
NGOs and aid organizations are now indicating that they are unable to know precisely who boards the ships. "We cannot scan to see who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons that people flee Libya, he added, so it is very probable that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that we keep track of this".
Italy's conservative former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, called for Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration, to make an immediate apology.
Musk seeks delivery record for Tesla
Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the opportunity to reach 100,000 deliveries in our first quarter," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
Demand is so strong that Tesla was able to record 110,000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge is getting the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to mobilize as many resources as possible at quarter-end.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares closed the day with a gain of over six percent. The price has not increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered around 95,000 cars and hit its best value to date.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. The company would have to hit six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter to do so. The less expensive Tesla Model 3 is in particular demand, but its profit margins are low. There have been losses recently despite the boom.
US Budget Dispute: Once More, Only Bridge Financing
The USA's new financial year will begin on October 1 without a proper budget. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and ratified temporary financing until November 21.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise the expenditure ceiling for financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once more facing the new fiscal year, which begins on October 1, without a spending plan. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and ratified temporary financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, a shutdown (a partial closure of the federal administration) would have occurred on Monday at midnight. President Trump still has to set the decision into effect.
Shutdown Averted
The federal administration will now be temporarily financed on the level of, and according to, the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress was unable to agree in time on the 12 spending bills that allocate the funds to the various departments and government agencies. For the time being, therefore, the federal government cannot profit from the spending framework, which has been expanded from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they hold the majority, have completed ten of the twelve bills. The spending bills reflect the Democrats' priorities, however, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Vice versa, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which will hardly be able to receive a majority of votes.
Opinions differ most sharply on allocating resources for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are obviously attempting to force an allocation of twelve billion dollars to build the wall: one of President Trump's biggest priorities. The Democrats oppose the plans to construct the wall, as well as its financing, which is actually earmarked for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the building of the wall had already escalated in December of 2018 and led to a 35-day showdown.
Opinions Differ on Building the Wall
It's currently unclear how the parties will come together on this issue. An extension of the transition financing past November 21 is more probable than an agreement on all twelve spending bills in the coming seven weeks. And a shutdown at that time is not out of the question.
Since Congress still cannot agree on the twelve spending bills in time, which risks a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining in popularity. Bill S.1877—Prevent Government Shutdowns Act of 2019 would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, prevent travel activities from the members of Congress, and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were submitted.
France permits artificial insemination of lesbians and singles
In France artificial insemination is intended to be usable by single women and lesbians in future. The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that would allow all women to benefit from in vitro fertilization. This means the demand for anonymous sperm donors is expected to increase noticeably.
The submission still requires the Senate's approval. In the emotional debate lasting three days, right-wing critics had warned that in future countless "fatherless children" would be raised. The French Bishops Conference has also objected to this innovation.
The new regulation is part of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It models the modern family as it only gives children to single or homosexual parents. According to them, the costs for artificial insemination for all women are to be covered by social security.
Insemination with sperm of deceased husband continues to be forbidden
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an application for amendment permitting widows to have access to their dead husband's sperm for the purposes of artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain "post-mortem" artificial insemination is allowed. In Germany there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain about not having access to the sperm of the deceased. The opponents of this infringement argued that a child conceived in this way would bear a "particularly heavy fate."
Numerous members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) belonging to President Emmanuel Macron and deputies of the opposition party had, on the other hand, spoken out in favor of artificial insemination with sperm of a deceased spouse. They emphasized a widow would be bearing the "double bereavement" if the death of her husband meant her wish for a child would remain unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that in future a widow can have herself inseminated with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now artificial insemination in France has only been allowed for heterosexual partners, who cannot have children. They must be married or have lived together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer, that surrogacy continued to be unlawful.
In Germany artificial insemination is in theory available to all women, but for singles and lesbian couples this continues to be a problem.
Compensation payment for climate: Calls for university drop-offs are getting more pronounced.
There is a lot of flying at university. This has prompted the country to take steps to apply a climate tax there, too. The principals say they do not have money for this. But now they are coming under pressure internally as well.
Universities are to be included in limiting their use of flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion adjourned before summer holidays about a climate charge on flights used by universities and high schools is back in full swing. After the State Rector's Conference reacted skeptically to a corresponding violation by the green-black coalition, plans are only receiving support from high schools. In a joint statement, doctoral students of six universities from Baden-Württemberg and a teachers' college pledged for compensation for business flights. This first step would be ‘urgently needed', at the same time there should be a wide debate about the avoid-ability of flights, their statement says. The cabinet shut down originally planned in July has been put on ice, because the CDU has not yet approved the submission handed in by the Green Party.
Russia re-arrests North Korean fishermen
The FSB secret service reports that the detainees had fished unlawfully in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had been arrested, with an exchange of gunfire between border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were wounded, the North Korean fisherman later dying from his wounds. But this time there were no injuries, it is reported.
Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage. The North Korean fishermen were in Russian waters for that reason. The Russian coast guard reports that it patrols these waters to protect Russia's maritime biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the repeated inspections, 30,000 squid were discovered in the boats and confiscated. Three trawlers and two motor boats are also reported to have been confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posyet near Vladivostok.
Following complaints from Russian companies, Russia's fishing authority did not issue any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to media reports, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been detained in Russian waters this year.
Georgy Martynov, president of the Primorye Fisheries Association in the Primorye region in the far east, also complained recently of the extensive environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They used close-meshed synthetic nets that are banned in Russia. These also remove tiny creatures from the sea. Furthermore, the nets had simply been discarded in the sea, where they would take 200 years to disintegrate.
No More Than 18,000 in the Future: The USA Lowers its Refugee Cap
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with an elected police delegation in the White House.
The richest land on Earth closes itself off to those seeking protection: As confirmed by the US State Department in Washington, the cap for the legal influx of refugees will be reduced further. In the future, primarily threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
Once more, the US government wants to reduce the already historically low cap for taking in new refugees. In financial year 2020, which in the United States runs from October 2019 to September 2020, no more than 18,000 people will be allowed into the country, declared the US State Department. In the financial year that is now almost over, the limit still lies at 30,000 people.
In recent years, the government of President Donald Trump has drastically lowered receptiveness for those seeking protection from all over the world. Under the previous administration of Barack Obama, far higher admission limits applied.
The planned cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department designated the USA the "most compassionate and generous nation in history": a wording that smacks of the parlance of the current US President.
"Dealing responsibly" with refugees means making it possible for the refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction there, Trump declared. He has received strong support from his adherents for his hard-line immigration policy, but also massive criticism.
A huge point of dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. To be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump has declared a national state of emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measures and current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is now under pressure due to the Selenskyj affair and possibly imminent impeachment proceedings.
According to the State Department, the US government wishes to concentrate on two groups of refugees in the future: People who are being persecuted because of their faith, and Iraqis who helped the US military in that nation and have thereby become endangered, the State Department has explained. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be added.
The USA wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in another country. In light of this fact, the United States entered into immigration treaties, first with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras as well, to stem the flow of immigration to the southern US border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
By request of the Argentine justice system, an orangutan female has been relocated from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a sanctuary for great apes in the USA. "Sandra," born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo was awarded the rights of a non-human person, which classes her release as urgent. The animal was shipped to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight—however not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as explained by lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez.
As the human ape weighing 53 kg is not in a position to adapt to a life in the wild, she will live in an open-air enclosure in the Center for Great Apes in Florida in future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees there, among them "Bubbles," Michael Jackson's former pet. Before moving to Florida, however, "Sandra" must endure a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After the night of her birth in Rostock, ‘Sandra' spent a few years in the former Ruhr zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The animal welfare process in 2014 regarding ‘Sandra's' fundamental rights has played a part in the fact that the zoo in Buenos Aires has been transformed into an eco-park. By 2023 a research and educational center to preserve biodiversity is to be created there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain-climber: 1,800 feet in 46 minutes.
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has set a new record climbing the almost 10,000-foot-high Grosse Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, false floor, or other aids, the Swiss climber tackled the 1,800-foot-high north face of the Grosse Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and assisted only by an absolute absence of dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds to complete the climb, He beat the previous record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the free solo speed record-holder in four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike reaps benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has achieved a significant profit increase. Nike´s net income increased in the past quarter to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros). The Group stated this was 25% more than in the same period last year. This is the result of the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" which puts the Adidas competitor Nike in direct communication with its customers.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period at the end of August. The greatest increase in Nike sales was in China with a growth of 22 percent. The Group from Beaverton, Oregon also profited from its approach of addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in China.
Chief financial officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thereby increasing its competitive advantage. The investors reacted positively to the quarterly figures as the shares rose by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban for racism in Italy
The Italian football club AS Roma has given a fan a lifetime ban on entering the stadium for making racist comments about professional footballer Juan Jesus. The Brazilian defender was insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and called on his club to take action. "@officialasroma you know what you should do with a fan like this. #NoToRacism. I'm proud of who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has played for AS Roma since 2016.
The club reacted late on Thursday, reporting the fan's Instagram account to the police. In addition, the Roma supporter can never attend a club match again, the club tweeted.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Fans regularly chant racist insults against the black players of opposing teams. "We can't have any racism in society or in sport. The situation in Italy has not improved, and that is very serious. Those responsible must be identified and thrown out of the stadiums," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said over the weekend. His statement was the result of racist chants during the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and ACF Fiorentina last Sunday.
But there have also been discussions recently about Juventus fans in Turin. The Italian authorities have imposed stadium bans on 38 rampaging supporters of the record-holding Juventus. Four of them are not allowed to return to the stadium for ten years, the police said. The remainder have been banned for four to ten years.
The supporters are linked with ongoing investigations into twelve ringleaders of extremist fan groups related to Juventus. The twelve are suspected of crimes including aggravated extortion, money-laundering, and domestic violence. The club initiated the investigations by filing a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the extremist ringleaders are involved in the illicit ticket trade. They are said to have "exercised military control" over ticket sales to fans and blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get hold of cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different to Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political—entire age categories are given catchy names. But if you look closely, the labels are steeped in contradictions. How well do these labels describe young peoples' perspective on life?
"The Crabs are Coming!" With this cry, the crab hunt at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun officially began on September 21, kicking off the opening ceremony of the nineteenth China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department for Publicity Work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern edge of Nanjing in the Jiangsu province, is a national environmental zone. It's the first international "Slow City" in China and the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. From an ecological standpoint, the city can boast ideal conditions, with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas, and 50 percent fields." Gaochun's generous natural environment offers its inhabitants all the prerequisites for becoming wealthy.
The citizens of Gaochun started farming crabs in the early 1990s. Crabbing eventually turned into a formative industry bringing high revenues and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively developed crab farming on a large scale in terms of ecology, the economy, and technological support. And the city has focused on the farmers' income, and on making agriculture more efficient.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform to "distribute power while optimizing the administration and government services" and diligently established the service network for "permits in one location, a law enforcement team, a network for services, and a platform for extending loans." This will allow the city to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services, and development.
Gaochun is exploiting local advantages by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and using the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a flagship for enticing intelligent high-end production operations; companies for biomedicine and medicinal technology, saving energy and protecting the environment; companies from the cultural and health sectors; and businesses for ecological agriculture that lead the "3+2" sector to settle here. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the formation of a national tourism zone that includes all areas, as well as nationally prominent tourist resorts. To that end, the Gaochun region's ecological and cultural resources have been integrated, the state of buildings for civil services and for public service comprehensively improved, the areas of "tourism +" and "+ tourism" energetically further developed, and the development of cultural tourism brought to a high level of quality. Gaochun definitely has a future worth looking forward to.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani talks about the end of sanctions—Trump disagrees
The Iranian president Hassan Ruhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly about a supposed offer by the USA to lift sanctions. In return for discussions with the Tehran leadership, the United States had put an end in sight for all sanctions, Ruhani explained on his official internet page.
However, the US president Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted for me to lift the sanctions imposed on him, so that there could be a meeting. I, of course, said no."
Ruhani describes the event thus: Chancellor Merkel, The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that there should be a meeting. "And America says, I will lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of punitive measures that were to be ended was under debate. "And they clearly said that they will lift all sanctions."
However, this move was not made in an acceptable manner, Ruhani lambasted. In the face of the punitive measures in place and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the start of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Mr Ruhani in New York. The backdrop was the hope of Europeans' hope of rescuing the Iran nuclear agreement they had negotiated with China and Russia. This is intended to deter the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weaponry. France's president Emmanuel Macron had, like Merkel commented on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, that Ruhani will meet with US president Donald Trump.
Serious earthquake near Istanbul—Almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, fears of a disaster are growing. 34 people were injured in the quake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This is fueling fears of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for safety reasons, said Oktay. He also reported that hundreds of buildings had been damaged. On Thursday, the 5.8-magnitude earthquake shook the Marmara region, which includes Istanbul, and triggered panic in the metropolis with its millions of inhabitants. The government now intends to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Turkey has been ill-prepared for earthquakes for 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The latent danger has been repeatedly ignored in the city itself. Poorly constructed buildings collapse every year—some already weakened by the many minor quakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, city planners such as well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that the large open spaces created in the city center as places of refuge have been built on. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August did the Chamber of Civil Engineers of Istanbul warn that an estimated one million buildings in the city are not earthquake-proof.
Disaster and Emergency Management Authority AFAD said the epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara off the coast of the Silivri district and at a depth of about 4.3 miles. A smaller quake a few minutes later caused even greater panic in the streets.
The mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that there had been no initial reports of injuries or damage. The state TV channel TRT showed people fleeing their houses in panic. In the district of Silivri, schoolchildren were evacuated from buildings for safety reasons. Pictures showed some of the schoolchildren crying.
Istanbul is especially prone to earthquakes. A section of the North Anatolian Fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, runs beneath the Sea of Marmara. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest happened near Istanbul in 1999. More than 17.000 people lost their lives at that time.
Researchers fear that there could be a quake with a magnitude of between 7.1 and 7.4. But when it will happen is not clear. Thursday's quake again struck the western part of the country and Istanbul.
Companies are drawing up emergency plans, private citizens have deposited "go-bags" packed with necessities outside their doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth quakes. When the next big quake will happen is not clear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. A few buildings had suffered minor damage. The Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu monitored developments from Istanbul's Catastrophe Coordination Center (Akom). He reported that two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer had collapsed.
Aftershock warning in Istanbul
Many social media users are reporting panic. Buildings trembled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were severed. It was stronger than the quake on Tuesday, one user wrote. On Twitter, Kerem Klinik, President of Turkish Red Crescent, warned of aftershocks. He called on people to keep away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is officially given as 1:59 p.m. local time. According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first quake, an aftershock measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale occurred.
On Tuesday, a magnitude-4.6 earthquake shook the Marmara region that was felt as far away as Istanbul. Disaster and Emergency Management Authority AFAD said the epicenter of this quake was also in the Sea of Marmara to the west of the capital.
It was not the only quake to hit the headlines this Tuesday. Pakistan was also affected by a severe quake.
Researchers believe there could be a disastrous earthquake in Istanbul at some point—there is extreme tension between the two tectonic plates. Scientists believe the tension will discharge one day—causing massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy thinks the latest earthquake is an early warning. It has made a disaster more likely, he told CNN Turkey. "This could be a sign of a bigger earthquake," Ersoy told CNN. "The big quake will come sooner or later".
A minor quake a few weeks ago caused major concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there was a strong earthquake only a few days ago, with 68 people injured. The earth also shook by Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel for conflict in the Ukraine affair
Two controversial documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair regarding US president Donald Trump's possible abuse of power. US democrats feel strengthened towards a possible impeachment procedure. The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone-call with the Ukrainian president provided important clues for investigations against the president. Even Trump himself once more feels like a victim of a witch hunt. He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet—Plane diverted
A United Airlines flight was diverted because a passenger was locked in the onboard toilet. The bathroom door was blocked during Flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline announced according to US media.
The woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin during an unplanned stopover in Denver Wednesday evening (local time). She had been locked in for almost one hour, US media wrote citing other passengers. Passengers were required to change aircraft to continue their flight to San Francisco.
In a video from Flight 1554 distributed online, US media report that multiple people can be seen trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says a man in the video. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes a Brexit novel
How does an author like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it—and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Kafka's unmistakable "The Metamorphosis," the British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel called "The Cockroach" will be available in print in German on the 27th November, as communicated by the Diogenes Publisher (Zurich). It describes the transformation of a man called ‘Jim Sams,' who was ignored or hated in his former life, and has now suddenly become the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as a mission to turn the will of the people into action and is wildly determined not to let anything nor anyone hinder him.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "When the parliament is shut down, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical time, when ministers are lying as shamelessly as the former soviet rulers, when Brexiteers in high positions are almost invoking a No-Deal, then an author has to ask himself what they can do. There is only one answer to that: writing." We had only just heard from McEwan in the spring with the novel "Machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's story first printed in 1915 tells of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself transformed into a monstrous insect," is gradually rejected by family and community and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down before Kafka in order to describe a world that is upside down," the Diogenes Publisher discloses.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria's railway infrastructure
11,200 railway cars in Austria and Hungary are being fitted with whisper brakes to reduce the noise generated by freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail links between Graz and Győr and between Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernized and electrified.
According to information from EU officials, this should make travel more comfortable and decrease CO2 emissions. The work is being financed by the EU "Connecting Europe Facility" infrastructure fund.
Thomas Cook: All trips canceled until October 31
One day after filing for bankruptcy, German travel agency Thomas Cook has canceled all trips up to and including October 31, 2019. Travel "could not be completed on legal grounds related to bankruptcy," the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings made with the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen, and Air Marin that have already been paid for partially or in full. The company has not confirmed how it will handle trips starting after November 1, 2019. Further action will be examined in coordination with the insolvency insurer, the company said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was caught up in the wake of the collapse of its British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which also includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours, and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers seek to transfer money to hotels immediately again
Conversely, hotels outside of Germany that are currently still accommodating Thomas Cook vacationers are set to receive money from the Zurich Insurance Group starting this Friday. According to Zurich, the payments to hotels include the condition that guests no longer be required to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting any separate receipts, resort hotels are now to receive 50 per cent of the outstanding payments, a Zurich speaker said to the news agency dpa. "This applies straight away and with the requirement that, starting immediately, these hotels not prompt or otherwise require Thomas Cook travelers to make individual payment for hotel bills," spokesman Bernd Engelien went on to say.
The insurance company was reacting to reports from hotel guests who claim they were being forced to pay for their accommodations themselves on site. Some of them had to lay out more than €1000. The German Travel Industry Association (DRV) and the German Federation of German Consumer Organization (VZBV) criticized this strongly.
The number of hotels affected will be determined on Friday with the insolvent travel agency, said the insurer's spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package customers were still on vacation outside Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the vacations and return travel of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to attempt to keep the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany operating and find a solution for the future.
However, the Zurich Insurance payments now announced for hotels will help travelers who are currently still abroad. Things look bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to go on vacation. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31 had been canceled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid for.
The company has not confirmed how it will handle trips starting after November 1, 2019. Further action will be examined in coordination with the insolvency insurer, the company said. In principle, the insurer Zurich will be responsible for these cases as well. The sale of new trips has been halted. dpa
The company refers to its insurer, Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers can obtain information on reimbursement options for the cost of trips on the Kaera website and can submit claims using a web form.
Prince Harry destroys blast mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing Lady Diana's work for a long time. In Africa, he is now following directly in his mother's footsteps.
Wearing a blue protective jacket, the British prince detonated and destroyed a blast mine in Angola.
On Friday morning, near the British Halo Trust camp in Dirico, he flipped the ignition switch in front of TV cameras At a safe distance in the savannah, the mine exploded without causing damage. The Halo Trust alone has destroyed over 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in Angola, yet there are still over 1,000 minefields endangering the population.
In Huambo, on the fifth day of his African visit, Price Harry wanted to follow directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). He wanted to retrace his mother's path accompanied by the same demolition expert who accompanied her. The pictures showing Princess Diana going through a cleared minefield in 1997 went round the world. She too had demonstrated her support for the Halo Trust.
Since Monday, Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day Africa trip that started in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Slow-moving Brexit talks: The risk of no deal remains acute
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that there will be no third postponement of Brexit talks while he is in office. But assertions by the controversial Briton often change. The latest ruling of the British Supreme Court hangs over Johnson's blond head like a sword of Damocles. His suspension of parliament in stubborn pursuit of his Brexit plant until the EU exit date was reversed early this week. And a law passed by parliament obligates Johnson to extend bilateral talks if negotiations with the EU have failed by October 31. However, Johnson has always categorically ruled this out.
Johnson still considers a deal possible
But he also does not exhibit any trace of the pressure. During a visit to a hospital, he has since suggested that he supports extending the talks if no deal is reached by the end of October.
We will comply with the law, you know.
But at the same time, we are confident that we shall leave the EU on October 31.
Preferably with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is running out for the Brexit talks in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent a no-deal Brexit. But the latest talks have again brought no breakthrough. A deal by the end of October is quite difficult to imagine right now. Unless the British prime minister breaks the law, another postponement of Brexit will take effect. But the opposition does not trust his words. They fear that Johnson will somehow be able to push Brexit through if there is no deal.
US Authorities: More Fatalities Caused by E-Cigarettes
The number of fatalities connected with the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. And the CDC, the US public health authority, has announced 805 people confirmed or probably injured in connection with the devices. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine," more than 900 people have been affected, and around 500 of those cases have been confirmed. The cause for the lung damage remains completely unclear. No similar increase in lung injuries is known In Europe so far. The complaints seem to be restricted to users in the USA.
Growing fears of new protests in Egypt
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared on social media millions of times. In them, the building entrepreneur and actor who lives in Spain calls for a "people's revolution." He has called for further protests this Friday against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who are accused of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with one million participants in central locations in the country.
The security authorities are certainly on alert. An increased police presence was already visible in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations were closed and streets around the centrally located Tahrir Square were blocked off. In recent days, police had increased their road checks and searched the cellphones of passersby for messages and photos connected with the protests.
On September 20, demonstrators also gathered around Tahir Square.
Last weekend there were protests involving hundreds and thousands of people in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura. There has not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces reacted with corresponding severity. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arrested arbitrarily just because "they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," said HRW, citing the lawyers of those arrested.
The organization also criticized censorship in Egypt. It said the government in Cairo is blocking websites and social media to suppress further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he toppled the democratically elected President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers, and activists have been detained in recent years, with some convicted.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs returns from his Greenland expedition
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition Friday. Among those waiting to greet him in the port of Hamburg was skipper Boris Hermann, who had taken climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic in the racing yacht "Malizia."
In his yacht "Dagmar Aaen" accompanied by a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated the coasts of Iceland and Greenland for signs of global warming over the past few months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, he said. He had waited years for the young generation to make itself heard. It has been known for decades that the Earth is getting warmer. But still, many people have acted as if there were a Planet B to escape to.
"What happens in the sea is usually hidden from the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and about the pollution of the seas. Activities during the expedition included the use of a drone to measure glacial ice in Greenland and of nets to fish microplastics from the water.
For his "campaign for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas," the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt received the Seadevcon Maritime Award during Hamburg Climate Week. "Arved Fuchs is a great example for all of us who are concerned about the survival of the oceans", said Skipper Boris Herrmann during the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic over the past decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome Tourists paid 430 Euro for noodles
430 Euro for two spaghetti dishes and fish in a simple restaurant near Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: That seemed too high a price for two Japanese tourists. Although the two women paid the bill, which included an 80 Euro tip, they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused heated reactions.
"Instances like that do damage to Rome's prestige. We entreat the police to investigate whether this is fraud," demanded the representative for Federagit, the association of tour guides in Rome, according to the Friday edition of the Roman daily newspaper ‘Il Messaggero.'
The restaurant owner's reaction came promptly. The Japanese women did not only order spaghetti, they also ordered fresh fish, the local owner said by way of defending himself. However, this is not discernible on the bill. The innkeeper also intimated that a tip of 20% of the bill total is normal.
One phone call to the Ukraine and everything is ruined? US President Donald Trump could face impeachment proceedings after the troubling revelations of the past few days, the democrats wish to conduct their investigation as quickly as possible in the House of Representatives - it could take weeks before the decision is made.
The beginning of the scandal was supposedly a telephone call to the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower who revealed the conversation due to concern for national security and the US democracy is horrendous: The president allegedly abused the power of his office in order to utilize the government of another country for the purpose of gaining influence in the 2020 election. He exploited Ukraine´s dependence by means of blackmail in order to force it to act against a political opponent.
The crux of this occurrence can also be garnered through the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky which was published in the meantime, even though it does not represent the full contents of the conversation. However, the telephone call from July 25th is just a fraction of a much larger story, the focus of which, besides Trump himself, is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the point of view of the public, the story began in May 2019, when the New York Times reported of Rudy Giuliani´s travel plans to Ukraine. He had intended to meet with the newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knew that his intentions were precarious. "We are not interfering with an election, we are interfering with an investigation, and we have a right to that", he told the newspaper. It could be seen as inappropriate, but "there was nothing illegal there". Giuliani wants the investigations, for which there is barely any evidence, to be carried out in Ukraine - "because this information is going to be very, very helpful to my client and could prove helpful to my government as well".
The lawyer and former mayor of New York City seems to have indulged in right-wing conspiracy fantasies, fixated on Trump´s opponent in the 2016 election: The critics at the time claimed that Hillary Clinton had conspired with persons in Ukraine in order to create a pretext for Russian investigations in the USA. This accusation, however, was never to be taken seriously.
This is exactly the kind of investigation that Trump spoke about so clearly on in the telephone conversation with Zelensky later on in July. The president´s and Giuliani´s version is as follows: Former vice president and currently a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Joe Biden had urged for the dismissal of the former Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin during his time as the Obama administration's representative to Ukraine. The goal was to prevent an investigation into the gas company for which he himself was responsible, and where his son, Hunter Biden served as a member of the board of directors. Biden senior had blackmailed Ukraine financially in order to conceal the corrupt machinations of his family.
The reality was somewhat different. At the time when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. In addition, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, and the US government was by no means the only Western partner to insist on his dismissal In addition, the Obama administration expressly supported the investigation of the company.
Instagram, Facebook, and Whatsapp disruption: Social media are down
Users worldwide are reporting massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. According to reports, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain have been the most affected. Users at allestörungen.de are reporting that Facebook has not loaded since around 3:30 p.m. Instagram is also returning an error message that content cannot be loaded. Even Whatsapp seems to be affected by the interruption, although not to the same degree.
Instagram and other social media often affected by disruptions
This is not the first widespread failure this year. Services were down for several hours in March and July. And, as during past incidents, users are falling back to Twitter to vent their frustration.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientist were saved by the Chilean air-force from the icy Antarctica. They were travelling in a dinghy and were several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky - the Chilean rescue helicopter arrived in less than an hour.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean air brigade said:
"We received the message at 9:30am, we were on our way shortly before 10, and in around 20 minutes we reached the dinghy".
Poland has been running the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977 and there are currently 19 scientists working there. The lost scientists were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: NEVER Charge your Smartphone Wirelessly
Practical but Dangerous
Although extremely practical, inductive technology via Qi standard should not be used.
Since many new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell well—especially the new iPhone 11—we'd like to remind you of a study done at the beginning of July. Charging mobile devices without a cord is practical but not necessarily recommended.
Higher Temperatures Stress the Battery
Researchers warn against charging smartphones wirelessly. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely dangerous for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly higher buildup of heat. If one charges a cell phone normally (with a cable), the battery reaches 80.6 degrees within three hours. But with wireless charging, researchers measured over 86 degrees even if the smartphone was perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the cell phone is placed near the coil, the temperature is even higher. Moreover, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn jacks up the use of power.
Capacity and Service Life
According to the researchers, temperature is a decisive factor in a battery's durability. And every degree matters. When charging with high temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but doesn't last as long. And this decreases its service life. Therefore, the researchers recommend always charging the smartphone with a cable. Since replacing batteries is expensive with modern smartphones, that may be a useful tip. Apple has even recently increased the costs for replacing batteries (again), applicable to all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply lay the device on an appropriate charging pad—these are even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels, and cars—and the battery will be charged without a cumbersome "cable salad" and tedious fumbling for a plug. Since with Qi (which stands for "inductive energy transfer") a worldwide standard is enforced that even Apple adheres to by way of exception, there are hardly any restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should not be used.
Photographer of Everest queues: Thirteen 26,000-foot peaks in six months
A Nepalese climber claims to have ascended thirteen of the world's fourteen highest mountains in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, said the organizer of his expedition.
The ex-soldier wants to climb all fourteen peaks in seven months Purja calls his plan "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: A picture that went viral in the spring, showing climbers standing in line on Mount Everest, was one of his shots.
The photo of the massive line triggered a debate about stricter safety measures on the 29,000 feet-high mountain, the world's highest. In May, eleven climbers died while climbing within a few days of each other.
Climbing the fourteenth 26,000-foot peak could be a problem for Purja. The Chinese authorities are blocking access to Mount Xixabangma in Tibet. Bad weather is one of the reasons given for this. Early in the week, Purja tweeted that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow him to climb the mountain.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
A pregnant cow elephant was also found among the dead animals, stated a police spokesperson on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the ancient Sigiriya rock fortress, which is popular with tourists. According to the police spokesperson, the animals were believed to be aged between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Almost 200 elephants are killed every year in Sri Lanka. They are often killed by farmers on whose land the animals had previously been living without causing damage. Around 50 people are also killed by elephants annually. This normally happens when the animals pass through villages near their habitat.
According to estimates, there are only around 7,000 elephants remaining in Sri Lanka. Killing an elephant can incur the death penalty.
Impounded British oil tanker leaves Iran
British oil tanker the Stena Impero is leaving the port of Bandar Abbas after being held by Iran for more than two months. This was announced by the maritime transport office in Bander Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized the British tanker on July 19 under the pretext that it had violated maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook management under criticism
The competent economic committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the failure of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail. The management's salary packages will be studied, as well as why the British government refused financial help for the company as it fought for survival. "We are focusing on supervision inside the company and monitoring by outside auditors," said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obviously dealing with a serious case of management greed."
Experts say the role of genes in the risk of intestinal cancer is overestimated
The role played by genes in the increased risk of common intestinal cancer has apparently been overrated until now. This was the conclusion reached in a recent study by researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are more serious than previously assumed. This has consequences for determining the individual risk of intestinal cancer, say the scientists at the Center.
Elon Musk allows Tesla shares to rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is so strong that Tesla was able to process 110,000 orders, according to Musk's e-mail.
The challenge is getting the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to mobilize as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this information: Tesla shares closed the day with a gain of over six percent. The rate has not increased as much in four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars and hit its previous high value.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. The company would have to hit six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter to do so. The less expensive Tesla Model 3 is in particular demand, but profit margins are low here. There were recent losses despite the boom.
Will the British government bypass the Brexit law? Johnson abstained
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being discrete about whether he is trying to find ways of bypassing the law on unregulated Brexit recently passed by the Parliament. When questioned to that end, Johnson has merely told journalists that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law obliges the government to request a postponement of the date of withdrawal if an agreement with the EU cannot be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiating with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major expressed the suspicion that Johnson might attempt to use "political chicanery" to circumvent the law. Johnson might use a procedural trick that would postpone the law's entry into force until after the withdrawal from the EU.
Johnson said he is striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We're confident about leaving the EU on October 31, and the best path is to do so with an agreement."
Iran is apparently starting Uranium enrichment
Iran's president Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contract partners about the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Regrettably the European states are showing an inability or lacking readiness when it comes to concrete action," Rohani said on Thursday at the press conference on the sidelines of the US General Assembly in New York. In case they do not stand by their promise, he put in view "further steps" away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated convention of 2015.
The backdrop is the conflict about the international convention to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The USA single-handedly got out of the agreement in 2018 in order to force Iran into a change of course with "maximum pressure" in what was considered aggressive Near East politics. The leadership of President Donald Trump wants to deal a new agreement and is imposing hard sanctions against Tehran in the meantime. Iran last reacted to this with a relaunching of the uranium enrichment limited in the contract.
The international nuclear energy authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report, that the Islamic Republic is now utilizing centrifuges installed at the beginning of September using Uranium, or has at least prepared them for use thus. According to IAEA information, Iran is moreover preparing the construction of over 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to carry their end of the deal and may for this reason leave Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of pressurizing US sanctions, Rohani presumed. However, more discussions are planned, which will hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia.
However, the situation changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September. Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attacks. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had committed to the attack, which the USA weighed up as a wrongful confession, though. "We have nothing to do with that," Rohani augmented his position.
"Those people who make such accusations have to provide evidence of this on a rolling basis," Rohani said. The European leaders were apparently not able to do that during talks with him at the UN General Assembly. Instead they would have only relied on the fact, that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani has in recent days met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before potential talks with US president Trump, the wide-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration should have to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of another star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from deep space. This has been achieved before. The comet helps draw conclusions about other solar systems.
What used to be only a speculation has now been confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The deep space comet was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The travelling comet was discovered on August 30th by an amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo observatory in Crimea.- and that using a self-made telescope with a 65 centimeter diameter. Later research by various observatories confirmed, not only that this was a previously unseen comet, but also that the comet did not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object sighted while travelling through our solar system, after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017.
2I/Borisov is a rare opportunity for astronomers to obtain a closer look into an unknown solar system, before the comet disappears never to be seen again. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles the comets of our own solar system, as the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute reported. "The comet's current speed is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency NASA in a press release.
According to the International Astronomic Union (IAC) the comet is of distinctly interstellar origins, and is currently moving along a hyperbolic path which is leading it out of our system, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. The Union is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. The interstellar comet, at first listed under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4 was given the designation 2I/Borisov in honor of the astronomer who discovered it, the first part of the name indicating that it was the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was sighted while approaching. The researchers had several months to study it. "The object will reach maximum brightness in December and will be visible through medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will be possible to observe the comet with large professional telescopes until October 2020".
Multiple observatories have already began observing the visiting comet. A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the description of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in the first study the diameter of the celestial object to between 2 and 16 kilometers. Recorded images from the Gemini observatory in Hawaii clearly show the tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already garnered a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar comet, which is similar to a fingerprint of its chemical composition. "This object´s spectrum is similar to the ones in our solar system and this indicates that its composition must be similar", reports the IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed through similar processes as ours, de León's colleague Javier Licandro added.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar comets in just two years suggests that these objects could provide a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent these comet visits may be. One of the next interstellar comets could be intercepted by a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to place a three-part space probe, the "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to science director at ESA Günther Hasinger, the probe should either intercept an new, intact comet from our own solar system or an interstellar object such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First airplane landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People´s Republic: China United Airlines' first passenger aircraft has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, which was a special honor for the captain and his crew.
Around 45 million passengers are expected to use the airport by 2022, and by 2025 the number should rise to 72 million. President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion euro project. China´s latest prestige project is also called the "starfish" due to its building structure.
The complex has four runways to date, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway will be used to transport passengers from the airport to the Beijing city center in only 20 minutes.
During construction, the Chinese stated repeatedly that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the much smaller Berlin airport, which has been under construction since 2006, has repeatedly been postponed. Conversely, the first passenger airplane landed in Beijing after only four years.
New Supersonic Aircraft to fly in 2030: Four and a half hours from London to Sydney
Flying from London to Sydney in only four and a half hours, is what the British UK Space Agency is dreaming of. What will facilitate supersonic flying in the 2030's is a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the Reaction Engines company from Oxfordshire will develop, American broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as having said. "That is the technology that could definitely do that," Agency director Graham Turnock told the broadcasting house. "We are talking about the 2030's for the launch, the work is already far advanced."
In order to drive the project forward, the British space agency wants to work closer with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transportation so far, Concord had been covering the distance between New York and Paris from 1976 to 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In the year 2000, at the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, there was an accident when starting a Concorde where all 109 passengers lost their lives. In the past year, the US American aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space authority Nasa, namely the ‘X-Plane.' Virgin Galactic also has these kinds of developments in its program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point to point transport," Reaction Engines has written on its home page, amongst other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5—that signifies five times the speed of light. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "next generation of authentically reusable space devices."
Unrest in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous whistleblowers in the Ukraine scandal
Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House in connection with the Ukraine scandal about the possible abuse of power.
"I want to know who provided the whistleblower with the information", said Trump on Thursday to the staff members of the US Embassy in the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was practically "a spy" and spies were dealt with "somewhat differently" in the past.
This was considered an attempt to intimidate whistleblowers. However, the event was not open to the public. However, several US media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted with indignation to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are based primarily on a written complaint by an anonymous secret service agent who raised serious allegations against Trump and his government office. Following intense public pressure, the whistleblower's statements were made public on Thursday.
As part of his statement, the whistleblower alleges to have received information from several government officials that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the core of the accusations is a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleague to conduct investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about Hunter Biden´s earlier business ventures in Ukraine and Joe Biden´s alleged attempt to protect his son against Ukrainian justice. Biden is leading the race for the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of a cover-up with regard to the telephone call to Ukraine: Leading government officials had attempted to keep the exact contents of the conversation concealed. As usual, an electronic text record was prepared. However, this record was removed from the database following the instructions of White House Lawyers after the interview and stored in a specially protected system instead. Only the rough draft of the conversation was released to date.
The whistleblower´s identity was not made public. The New York Times reported that the person concerned is an employee of the CIA Foreign Intelligence Agency.
On Friday, Trump questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of tweets, the President wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had received second-hand information which turned out to be untrue. Therefore, there were likely no whistleblowers or spies.
However, the way Trump spoke about those who are said to have passed the information on to the whistleblower caused outrage. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker in the House of Representatives was unsettled and said that Trump´s statement once again undermined government integrity.
Various committees in the House of Representatives have been conducting various investigations against Trump and his associates for months. In light of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are pursuing investigations with renewed momentum to launch a possible impeachment trial against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for the investigation ", said Adam Schiff, the Head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Trump sharply criticized Schiff, accusing him of misrepresentation and again demanded that the Committee Chairman resign. Trump often criticized Schiff and had been demanding his resignation for months.
In a statement published on Friday, more than 300 former US government employees from security and foreign policy domains, the majority of whom worked under Democratic presidents as well as a few Republican presidents, supported the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible impeachment trial. In the statement, it was claimed that, should the accusations prove to be true, it would mean "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump.
There is no exact plan for further proceedings. The Democrats could initiate impeachment proceedings due to holding the majority in the House of Representatives. However, the decision regarding an actual removal from office would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans hold the majority. Therefore, such a procedure has low chances of success. To date, no US President has been removed from office through an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council Jobs being cut "stealthily"
Volkswagen's plans to further reduce production costs could affect production in Germany and Europe. This is cause for concern for the car manufacturer's works council. The firm wants to cut its annual factory costs of EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023. EUR 500 million of this figure is to be saved this year.
Personnel costs are one approach. The "future package" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 calls for the abolition of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Essentially, a job with the car manufacturer can be cut only if there is some form of evidence that the activities associated with the job are no longer required. In addition, an employment guarantee is in force until 2029.
People associated with the works council told our newspaper that production jobs should not in fact be affected will be cut "stealthily" in another way—circumventing the official policy. Consequently, regular positions that become vacant are often not re-filled.
In such cases, the works council has no way of enforcing the refilling of those posts. Meanwhile, there are personnel shortages in many places, workloads are increasing, and concerns are growing that the car plant will gradually hemorrhage. There are also increasing fears that car production might gradually shift away from Germany and Austria because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW merely states that, "as agreed in social contracts, the volume of employment will be adjusted along the demographic curve".
VW wants to standardize worldwide production even more and control new projects centrally. This should also reduce costs and accelerate decision-making—the aim behind this is to boost productivity and hence competitiveness. At a manager conference in Berlin, Director of Production Andreas Tostmann said: "We are well advised to make ourselves crisis-resistant particularly in uncertain times with Brexit and an imminent trade war between the United States and China".
Successes have already been achieved along this path: This year, for example, production costs per vehicle have fallen relative to the previous year for the first time since 2013. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, to be rolled out in Wolfsburg on October 24, has been reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not provide exact figures on the length of production, but according to information from our newspaper, the time required to manufacture a Golf 7 is around
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant at Wolfsburg is the only VW site where cars are made. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce parts. An internal VW rule of thumb applies to Wolfsburg whereby 800,000 cars must be manufactured there each year so that the plant remains sufficiently profitable. However, production capacity in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles in 2018 due to the falling demand for diesel and difficulties with conversion to the new WLTP fuel consumption and emission testing procedure.
Tostmann announced last year that one million cars should roll off the assembly line in Wolfsburg "in the future." That should allow Golf production to be focused in the main factory, as the Zwickau plant is being converted to electric car manufacture and will discontinue the manufacture of Golfs.
The SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also made in Wolfsburg, but sales of the Golf and Tiguan have been falling lately. So expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, the Golf 8 is to remain the primary product of Wolfsburg for the moment.
Forced into prostitution by use of voodoo: Convicted human traffickers
Young women from Nigeria are made to take oaths, trafficked into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution work. Six presumed human traffickers have to go to prison.
On Friday in Bochum six presumed human traffickers from Nigeria were convicted to parole and prison terms of up to eight years and three months. The accused had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to make them obey, the Nigerian women willing to leave their country had to take a ritual oaths with a voodoo priest in their homeland first.
The victims were aged between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean Sea with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, their dream of a better future did not come true. Once arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the supposed trafficking costs of an average of 25,000 Euro. Their wage was therefore completely reduced.
The accused, four men and two women, had admitted the trafficking and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to brothels in court. "The work was physically and emotionally difficult to bear," Judge Isabel Hoffmann during the sentencing. "Some of them were really disgusted."
The judgements are for commercial and gang-based trafficking of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe coerced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
As the dispute with the Lufthansa Group goes on, the air steward union UFO has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the labor union will "announce industrial action at the Lufthansa Group on October 14th," stated UFO vice-chairman Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have for months refused to conduct wage negotiations with UFO. The question is whether the trade union has lawfully terminated collective negotiations with Lufthansa.
UFO views its position as strengthened following a ruling by the Frankfurt Labor Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective negotiations had not been terminated. The court rejected its claims. The company acknowledged the ruling and is considering an appeal. "I consider it unlikely that a second court will view the situation in a completely different way," said Flohr.
Lufthansa also filed a claim with the Frankfurt State Labor Court in August to subject the status of UFO as a trade union to judicial review. The company argues that the trade union has for months failed to appoint a board authorized to represent it and so is unable to fulfill its role as a collective agreement partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union during which numerous members of the executive and advisory boards resigned, including long-time union boss Nicoley Baublies. UFO had suspended an initial vote on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to the doubts about its leadership.
Simplified entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But that is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf is seeking to introduce new visa requirements.
With its new visa system, Saudi Arabia plans to attract more international tourists in the future. The goal is to increase the numbers of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year by 2030, the Commission for Tourism explained.
"Opening Saudi Arabia up to international tourism is a historic moment for our country," said Commission Chairman Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has been difficult for tourists to access in the past. Visas are normally only approved for short business trips or religious pilgrimages, or for visitors with relatives in the desert nation. With the new rules, the ultraconservative kingdom hopes to generate additional income from the tourist industry. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In September, two of the most important oil facilities in Eastern Saudi Arabia were struck by multiple rockets: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abqaiq as well as the Khurais oil field. As a consequence, domestic oil production fell drastically and oil prices shot up. It will take several weeks for oil production in the kingdom to reach its previous level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber in the midst of wedding preparations
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing their wedding. In her Instagram stories, the model posted several party photos featuring her wedding look on Thursday (local time). Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others threw her a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, one of which featured a banana print, and wrote: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple will be getting married in a church this weekend.
The Biebers said yes a year ago in a New York registry office. There had been no large wedding party at the time.
In a recent interview with Vogue Australia, Hailey explained that they were on the same page after the initial issues: "If you´re not ready to compromise, you cannot be in a relationship".
Airplane Crash in the Czech Republic Kills Two
Two people have died in a small airplane crash in the western Czech Republic. According to the police, the wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forested area near the city of Měčín. The victims were a 38-year-old woman and 64-year-old man.
The authorities had searched for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew issued an emergency signal via GPS. The search also involved a military helicopter. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located around 30 kilometers south of Plzeň and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European Tree Varieties are Threatened with Extinction
Causes for the threat include pests, disease, nonindigenous species, unsustainable deforestation, and the growth of cities, reported the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Friday in Brussels. They studied each of the 454 known species of trees in Europe. Of those, 265 are endemic to continental Europe. And of those 265, 58 percent are in danger. Sixty-six are already at the highest threat level and therefore face extinction.
The IUCN divides threatened species into six categories: NT (near threatened); VU (vulnerable); EN (endangered); CR (critically endangered); EW (extinct in the wild); and EX (extinct). In all, it lists more than 28,000 plant and animal species worldwide as threatened.
Mountain Ash and Wild Horse-Chestnut Threatened
David Allen, one of the authors, told the German press agency (DPA) that the biggest threat in Germany is to the Mountain Ash (Sorbus). "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or through the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the common wild horse-chestnut. Since 2017, it has been classified as "vulnerable," step two on the IUCN scale. The greatest threats are posed by a fungus and the Balkan leaf-mining moth. Since the 1980s, it has spread from southeast Europe over the entire continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse-chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000. This assessment does not consider trees in cities, parks, or avenues.
Shrub Species and Mosses Also in Danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists are compiling new European red lists for mollusks, shrubs, and mosses. More than one-fifth of mollusks and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is primarily due to the destruction of the wilderness, the introduction of foreign species, agricultural practices, and climate change. Mollusks such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation for overlooked and underestimated species is precarious: species that form the backbone of the European ecological system and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of the European Regional Office of IUCN. "We must limit the effect people have on our ecosystem and make protecting these species a priority."
Earthquake in Istanbul: 34 Casualties Reported
Thirty-four people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. No fatalities were reported. Dozens had to leave their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul are reportedly closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
According to his account, hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the day before, there were reportedly almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the 5.8 magnitude earthquake devastated the Marmara Region, which includes Istanbul, and triggered panic in the metropolis with its millions of inhabitants.
Now the government wants to employ a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Turkey has been ill-prepared for earthquakes for 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is especially prone to earthquakes. A section of the North Anatolian Fault, which marks the border between the European and Anatolian Plates, runs beneath the Sea of Marmara.
One of the most severe earthquakes happened near Istanbul in 1999 and had a 7.6 magnitude. The epicenter was located in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people lost their lives.
On Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook the region surrounding Istanbul. The authorities called on residents to keep away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira to appear in the half-time show
The Latina pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will perform the half-time show of the next American Football Finals Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter "It doesn't get bigger than this," Shakira wrote next to a photograph of herself and Lopez. She is really nervous about standing on the Super Bowl stage. This will take place in Miami on February 2nd, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez explained that in 1996 she dreamed about making an appearance at the Super Bowl—in those days she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special, because the NFL is 100 years old and I will be performing with another Latina. She can't wait to "show what we girls are capable of on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira indicated in a statement that she felt honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages worldwide, representing Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And it's even going to be on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it is the first time that both "queens" are on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Battle against sinking audience figures.
The Super Bowl is the height of the American Football Season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have decreased audience numbers: This February, the spectacle lured the least viewers in the USA in over ten years. There were still nearly a hundred million viewers on average.
There had been turmoil in advance of the show of the past Super Bowl half-time show. In the dispute over how quarterback Colin Kaepernick was treated, the previous February according to media reports, pop stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Eventually the pop group Maroon 5 opened the half time show—reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, who used to be quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers had gone down on his knees before the 2016/17 NFL playing of the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick started a movement with his protest, countless players joining in the gesture. This caused big excitement, US president Donald Trump fiercely criticizing the mainly Afro-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been without a club since March 2017 and has not played another NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels receive money from insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook will be costly for some banks. There is a risk of enormous write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse will also be affected by this, writes the Financial Times in its Friday edition.
Banks like Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, or Credit Suisse would have to write off a total of up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) from their books, the report says. This was indicated in estimates from consulting company AlixPartners.
Bond creditors would have to accept write-offs of between £900 million to £1 billion and lenders of between £550 and £825 million. The amounts to be actually written off are more likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
The scale of the losses for creditors will be evident after the insolvency proceedings. A person close to the proceedings did not offer much hope. For example, the 40 aircraft owned by Thomas Cook in Great Britain were "old" and much of the properties are in poor condition. The most money could be gleaned by selling the airport slots and removing the Thomas Cook label, they added.
Rackete alleged to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are alleged to have tortured and murdered people in Libya. "We cannot rule it out, but we have no precise information," the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, said to news agency dpa.
The three men were recognized by other migrants in Italy. They were accused of having raped, tortured, and killed people in Libya. The suspects were arrested at the reception center in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organization was unable to verify who they allowed to board their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete brought illegal migrants into the port of Lampedusa on June 29, ramming an Italian Financial Guard ship in the process. The three suspects are said to have arrived there that day. The captain is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
United States warns German government about Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the German government not to trust the Chinese network equipment provider Huawei.
"We consider the risks too great", Pai told Handelsblatt newspaper regarding the expansion of the new 5G cellular network.
China, he said, has a "national security law" under which every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" is obliged to obey instructions from security authorities.
Furthermore, the applicable law prohibits companies from informing third parties about such enquiries, the FCC chairman continued. That makes it very difficult to trust the integrity of technical equipment and services.
Meanwhile, the federal government has agreed to demand a "declaration of integrity" from suppliers.
Berlin first wants to try to contain the risks through measures such as technical solutions, reported Handelsblatt, citing its own sources.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology consists of more than just hardware:
The software itself is important for keeping devices up to date. "This software consists of millions of lines of program code which change over time," said Pai.
"It is very difficult to imagine a government authority anywhere being able to check each update in real time in order to detect security risks," Pai continued.
He accuses the Chinese corporation of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus.
Ownership of the company is unclear. The employee association, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, Pai told Handelsblatt.
The United States has information that government employees have been placed in the company. Pai was in Berlin recently to promote the US position.
Fire in chemical factory in northern France: Schools closed
The locals hear explosions during the night. A gigantic wall of fire illuminated the sky above a chemical factory in northern France. The fire was extinguished after mere hours - but the cleanup could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and kindergartens in the region remain closed.
The responsible prefecture announced that the facilities would not be opening on Friday in twelve districts, as a precautionary measure. The Interior Ministry had asked citizens to stay indoors as much as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. No one was injured. Farmers and livestock breeders were advised to keep their animals indoors and protect their food, as well as to stop harvesting for the time being.
The prefecture announced that the fire had been completely extinguished on Thursday. The prefecture warned of the risks of smoke spreading after the fire had been extinguished on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the time.
A gigantic gust of black smoke rose from the chemical factory. The French media reported of huge flames and explosions in the factory belonging to the company Lubrizol, which produces oil additives. The production plant is a kilometer away from the city center.
According to officials, the factory in Normandy is in the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites that are subject to special monitoring. In 1976 a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso, near Milan in Italy.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, stated for the news channel BFMTV that initially no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. The prefecture explained that dams had been built on the river for the purpose of pollution prevention.
The authorities reported that the fire started around 02:40am. The cause is so far not clear. Rouen is a large city in the region and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port of Le Havre.
French finance minister: "Germany must invest right now."
French Minister of the Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called for greater investment from Germany in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
"Germany must invest right now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said Thursday evening when presenting the French budget for next year.
"The economy is the eurozone is stumbling," he warned.
"We can't wait for the economic situation to deteriorate before making the necessary decisions."
Those countries with sufficient budget reserves for more investments are the ones that should act, said Le Maire, in reference to Germany and others.
France does not have this reserve, he added, referring to his country's high national debt. France's debt accounts for 98 percent of GDP. The national debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced," said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has made repeated appeals for Germany to increase public investments in order to revive the European economy. In turn, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to keep its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday includes tax reductions worth over €9 billion for households.
This is one way in which the French government is reacting to the protests by the yellow vest movement. New borrowing should fall to 2.2 per cent after the 3.1 per cent expected this year.
Is He Still Trying to Trick Us?: Johnson Dodges Questions about Brexit Tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson has sharp criticism for the "capitulation act" ratified by parliament.
The parliament is back, and a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still make use of a loophole. When asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician skirted the issue.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being discrete about whether he wants to implement an unregulated Brexit, despite the law recently passed by Parliament that is supposed to prevent just that. When questioned to that end, Johnson has merely told journalists that his government will comply with applicable law.
The law prescribes that the government request a postponement for the date of withdrawal if an agreement with the EU cannot be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiating with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major expressed the suspicion that Johnson might attempt to use "political chicanery" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister might use a procedural trick that would postpone the law's entry into force until after the withdrawal from the EU. Johnson said he is striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We're confident about leaving the EU on October 31, and the best path is to do so with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Adviser, Dominic Cummings, has stated in the meantime that he sees the political conflict surrounding Brexit as a "walk in the park" and seems confident that the sought-after withdrawal from the EU will happen: "We're enjoying this, we're going to win, we're going to leave (editor's note: the EU), don't worry," said Cummings at a book presentation, according to the British Newspaper "Telegraph."
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election before the EU referendum 2016, now functions as the Chief Strategist in the British seat of government on Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into an almost inescapable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and Janis Joplin: They all stood before the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it's not always glamourous. The photo album entitled "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taschen) goes deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and the Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney posted on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the immediate magic of Polaroid film."
For Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Arizona until she found photography, the camera was always close at hand. She made thousands of Polaroids, of which a few hundred are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries."
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, some hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen, and other interiors from the early 70s until the late 90s. "She wanted genuine moments," the art critic Ekow Eshun wrote in his forward. And naturally, one thing always took center stage: her husband Paul, as many had possibly never seen him.
He's shown dancing while carrying his daughter Mary on his shoulders, talking on the phone in his bathrobe with a bag on his head, and wearing misshapen Moon Boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but one that led a fully normal life outside the spotlight on their farm in south England or in Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that as a baby she slept in a bed her father had built from old potato crates. And the McCartney house has not always been tidy.
The Polaroid camera captures the immediate moment like hardly any other medium. Linda McCartney's photographs are definitely a type of family diary, but they're more than just snapshots.
It all comes down to the decisive click: "You have to recognize when a terrific photo is taking place in front of you. And then snap it at just the right moment," says Paul McCartney. "If you snap it two seconds later or earlier, it can be a totally different picture." And Linda always had a talent for capturing it at just the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the detail, and the colors were all correct, making "The Polaroid Diaries" into not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but, besides all the anecdotes, a great aesthetic pleasure where landscapes work like abstract paintings. The perfect supplement to the Beatles album "Abbey Road," which appeared exactly fifty years ago and has been reissued.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions against Iran, Turkey will continue to import oil and gas from its neighbor. In an interview released on Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Turkey cannot terminate its oil and gas imports from Iran.
"We shall continue to by our gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, he admitted that Turkey has problems with the import of Iranian oil because a few companies had "pulled out due to US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey "will maintain our relations with Iran, in particular in relation to this matter and many others," said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran.
Since withdrawing from the international nuclear treaty, the United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and does not abide by the treaty.
US sanctions have caused a collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis. Tensions in the Gulf have increased considerably over the past few months.
US government to restrict admission of refugees
The US government wants a drastic reduction in admission of refugees. The United States Department of State explained on Thursday that their annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be reduced to 18,000 instead of 30,000 refugees. That is a reduction of 40%.
The Department of State explained that the USA would continue to show obligation toward support of refugees. Their primary purpose, however, is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently the immigration system in the US is overloaded.
The US government wants to concentrate on adding two refugee groups in future. People who are being persecuted because of their faith, and Iraqis who helped the US military in that nation and have thereby become endangered, the State Department has explained. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be added.
For the 1980 program, refugees are selected from UNO camps around the world and resettled in the USA. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year of 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current upper limit of 30,000 refugees is already an all-time low. When US president Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, this figure was at almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the announced decrease of the upper limit. "That is a very sad day for America," said the director of International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The USA would be damaging their status as leading role in protecting vulnerable people in the world even further.
Trump tries to set strict limits on legal as well as illegal immigration into the USA. According to some information, the US government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the budget year ahead. These figures are separate to those of the resettlement program.
Donald Trump—"More like an informer"
US president Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the espionage Whistleblower affair. Whoever had given relevant information to the informer who accused him of abuse of power, "is more like a snitch," Trump said according to a record kept by a private event in New York on Thursday. This was reported unanimously by several US media outlets.
Accordingly, Trump spoke about employees of the American UN Mission. When he was queried about the person, who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he responded, "It is more like an informer." Then Trump added, "Do you know, what we did in the olden days, when we were smart?" That's right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with that a little differently from how we do now."
Observers evaluated the last observation for a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats practiced harsh criticism on Trump's comments and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was an attempt, to hinder a congress investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the committees for evaluation, secret services and supervision in the house of representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now disclosed complaint, of having abused his office in order to solicit interference from another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj during the summer. In the conversation Trump suggested to him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in the Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear, who the whistleblower himself might be as well as who the informant is. As reported by the New York Times, the identity of the whistleblower is reputedly an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence agency.
Refugee Boat Capsized: Baby and Small Children Drown in the Aegean
People are continually trying to cross the Aegean Sea to get to Greece from Turkey. And the boats they use often capsize because they are much too small. Seven immigrants have now died in the sinking of a rubber raft—including five children.
Seven immigrants died at the Greek island Chios when a rubber raft sank. The victims included a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women, and five men were reportedly rescued from the floodwaters by the crew of a passing ferry.
The victims are said to include a smuggler, reported the local news agency of Chios, Alithia.gr. The immigrants set out from Turkey in the morning. They were attempting to reach Inousses, the small group of islands in the northeast of the island Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries from which the immigrants came are still unknown. Hundreds of immigrants from Turkey are currently ferrying to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, most in boats that are much too small. According to The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year.
The Who cancel their concert
A US concert by The Who rock-band ended suddenly due to illness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of a performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice packed up. During the eighth song, Daltrey said to the public, "I think I should leave it while it still works."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that now Daltrey "now definitely can't speak." Townsend promised the public, to give them their money's worth at a reparation concert. But a date has not been confirmed yet.
The planned appearances for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver have cancelled. They plan to catch up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74 year old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Leasing Suddenly Discontinued: WeWork Causes Real Estate Markets to Tremble
WeWork has become the largest office tenant in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork has climbed from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is experiencing a crisis. Landlords must fear revenue in the billions.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company discharged founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed its planned initial public offering, and with the sale of subsidiaries and assets (such as the private jet for the executive staff) began to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. Moreover, the British "Financial Times" and others have reported that WeWork stopped the conclusion of nine rentals, effective immediately. This means that the largest tenant of office space in New York, London, and elsewhere, has suddenly left the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces for the long term and lets them to members for the short term in partially small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups, or entire departments of large corporations. Until now, WeWork has burned through money with breathtaking speed while transacting its business. Last year the company earned 1.8 billion dollars but lost 1.6 billion. This year, rental costs alone are expected to reach an estimated 2.5 billion dollars through the leasing of ever newer and larger spaces. To limit loss, the new company management has now reportedly put on the emergency brakes and stopped leasing new spaces, effective immediately.
According to the "Financial Times," by now WeWork has entered into lease agreements with terms of up to 15 years, from which obligations of more than 40 billion dollars arise. Those huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company and its investors, but for the entire real estate markets.
As calculated by economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, in the past 24 months WeWork has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world. WeWorks' new contracts alone made sure the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new spaces that came onto the market during this period. Without the WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased, as Alpert wrote in "Business Insider." It looks similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office buildings in prime locations.
In the British capital as well, the balance in the real estate market could be notably delayed without the further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant of an office building in the center of the financial metropolis that was bought by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have invested dearly in refurbishing their real estate to meet WeWork's requirements. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, real estate owners will probably have to write off part of the billions in revenues they had hoped for. Despite long-term lease agreements, they have no access to WeWork's reserves, although these are scarce. Because WeWork's individual locations are normally leased by founding extra subsidiaries known as "Special Purpose Vehicles" for which the parent company is liable only within narrow limits.
Russia arrested numerous North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coastal guard has once more taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a further 262 poachers have been arrested for fishing illegally in these waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB is reputed to have informed the Interfax agency on Friday.
161 North Korean fishermen had been arrested only ten days previously. Before that, the border guards had been shot at and three of them had been injured. But this time there had been no wounded, according to reports. Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage.
For that reason, the North Korean fishermen were underway in Russian waters. The Russian coast guard reports that it patrols these waters in order to protect Russia's maritime biological resources. New controls had found 30,000 octopi. Also, three trawlers and two motor boats are reported to have been confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posyet near Vladivostok. For 2018 the coastal guard confirmed over 8,000 violations to the Ria Nowosti agency.
Following complaints from Russian companies, this year Russia's fishing authority issued no fishing licenses to the North Koreans. According to media reports, in 2019 thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been detained in Russia.
Georgiy Martinov, head of the association of Russian fishing enterprises in the Primorye region in the far east, also complained recently about high environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They had used tightly-meshed synthetic nets which are banned in Russia. They had also used these to fish tiny creatures from the sea. Moreover, the nets had simply been disposed of in the sea, where it would take 200 years for them to disintegrate. Even the boats they used did not correspond to the hygienic and technical standards required.
Moscow reported that during the arrests in the previous week three Russian coastal guards had been injured. A North Korean who was also injured is reported by FSB to have later died of his injuries. On this day of September 17th, Russian border guards seized a North Korean boat and subsequently another boat that had opened fire.
USA Issues a Travel Ban Against Ex-President Castro
The USA has issued travel bans against the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. On Thursday, the American State Department justified this in an announcement citing Castro's participation in "severe human rights violations." As head of the Communist party of the Caribbean nation, he presided over a system in which thousands of Cubans were deliberately arrested and there were more than one hundred political prisoners.
As the commander of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro shared the blame for human rights violations in Venezuela as well, where he was supported by its President, Nicolás Maduro. "The abuse of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the continuing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump issued travel bans against members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has raged for months. The USA has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and to help the leader of the opposition and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaidó, to come to power.
Cuba is one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the service of dispatched doctors. The USA and the Venezuelan opposition believe Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress its opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people again want to take to the streets for the sake of better climate protection.
To conclude an international week of climate strikes, Fridays for Future is planning further events and rallies in dozens of countries. Because of the different time zones, the protests are to start in New Zealand and Australia before spreading to North America via Europe. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg is to attend a mass rally in Montreal, Canada. The demonstrators also plan to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is not quite clear how large the worldwide response will be after last week's record attendance. Thunberg herself was optimistic. "Over four million people went on strike for the climate last Friday. This Friday we'll do it again," she tweeted. So far there have been 6,383 protests in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
In Germany, the response last Friday was particularly big. Fridays for Future estimates that one third of all worldwide protesters—about 1.4 million people—gathered in 575 German cities. This time, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, according to a list compiled by the protest movement. People intend to take to the streets for the climate not just in large cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne but also in smaller towns and districts such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland in Sylt.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament to demand that her country's politicians take stronger action on climate protection. Out of this, Fridays for Future was soon born. It was mostly pupils and students who took part in the climate protests, but scientists and other adults also participated increasingly.
Together they are demanding greater commitment from politicians in the struggle against global warming and the impending climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be kept to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial age.
Almost one month ago, Thunberg arrived in New York aboard an ocean-going racing yacht following a two-week transatlantic trip. There, she finally attended climate protests and UN summits. At the United Nations on Monday, she delivered an emotional speech in which she appealed to the consciences of state and government leaders. In her home city of Stockholm on Wednesday, she received the alternative Nobel prize from the Right Livelihood Foundation for her engagement for greater climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be able to smoke on balconies in the future. This is a requirement of a change to fire safety rules. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker for the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Moscow on Thursday, according to the agency TASS. The ban will come into effect on October 1.
Those who still smoke will have to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (€42.46). If the cigarette starts a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, this ban also covers the burning of candles. Grilling meat on a balcony is now prohibited also.
Blow Against Cybercriminals: Investigators Raid Servers
In the war against internet crime, German investigators have raided a large server provider for the first time, due to illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 culprits are suspected of operating a computer center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle River that hosted numerous websites through which the internationally acting criminals carried out their schemes.
This was announced by the Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a large-scale operation. The darknet is a shielded part of the internet.
The suspects' customers were allegedly the operators of the second-largest darknet marketplace for drugs in the world, "Wall Street Market," which investigators broke up early in the year. And the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled through a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General.
This was reportedly the first time that such a host was raided in Germany. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
The seizure operation was supported by special units, such as the GSG 9 (Border Protection Group 9 of the Federal Police), and involved raids in Germany and neighboring countries. They are the result of investigations lasting almost five years. The investigators will provide more detailed information at noon.
New worldwide climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people intend to take to the streets again today to call for better climate protection.
To conclude an international week of climate strikes, Fridays for Future has planned further events and rallies in dozens of countries.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne, as well as in smaller towns and districts such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg is to attend a mass rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests | Who is pulling Thunberg's strings?
A sense of justice and courage are lofty virtues even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke-belching factories that are heating the climate. So it is all the more striking that a 16-year-old girl is holding a mirror up to today's people in power. But what is her motivation? Is it a willingness to help, or the clever marketing of a climate activist? A historic masterstroke or manipulative tactics on her own account?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is stirring the masses and making young people rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, this is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over children and young people. As far back as 1212, a boy called Nikolaus from Cologne believed himself destined to work towards bringing about a fairer world. He was able to win over a horde of young people and talk them into crossing the sea with him to the Promised Land, just as Greta Thunberg recently did with her sailboat voyage to the America.
But is there a dark side? Why is a campaign called "We don't have time" needed to save the world? Greta Thunberg also has rich PR managers on her side. Incidentally, her mother has published a book that has sold all over the world thanks to her prominent daughter. Even long-established supporters of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant at the latest PR show, i.e., the boat trip, which some found excessive. This is not unfounded, as the impressive action went down very well with the world's press and has caused a lot of money to flow.
Opinions differ over this: Is it morally right to get rich from saving the world? Is it still legitimate if certain groups of people collaborate with stockbrokers during the campaign to save the world? Whatever the conclusion that will finally be drawn, a critical and considered perspective is always more important in a democratic society, for democracy draws its existence from varied opinions and debates. Therefore, it can be useful to take a critical look at even apparently righteous activities by certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
An unknown comet is currently travelling through our solar system.
Astronomers suspicions have been confirmed: An unknown comet has been travelling through our solar system—it is only the second one of its type.
Garching/Washington—Scientists have long suspected it, but they are now certain: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system at this moment. It was christened after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently taking up the attention of astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: A comet has been discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea.
The said solid body was discovered by an amateur astronomer called Gennadi Borissow in Crimea. He was looking at the sky through a home-made telescope and further night-time observations confirm his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet which is not from our solar system. It is only the second of its type that has been spotted flying past.
Astronomers now have a big chance of getting a close-up view of an unknown solar system. Apparently the comet resembles those of our own solar system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. According to the International Astronomic Union (IAC) the comet is of distinctly interstellar origins, and is currently moving along a hyperbolic path which is leading it out of our system.
The comet had already been sighted before its approach and can be observed for several months.
But before it gets to that stage, astronomers can watch it closely. Then in contrast to its predecessor, 2l/Borisov has already been sighted before its approach, which means that it can be examined from earth for many months to come. "The object will reach its greatest brightness by mid-December and will then still be visible through medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Davide Farnocchia of the Nasa US space agency explains. "After that it will still be visible through bigger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessors of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge about comet 2I/Borisov stirs hopes in science.
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be from 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets, because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star's spectrum is similar to our ones. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed through similar processes as ours, de León's colleague Javier Licandro added.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that already two such objects have been discovered in the space of only two years may allow a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems.
Researchers are always preoccupied with asteroids. Recently a giant asteroid raced past the earth and got dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely Reprehensible": Rachel Johnson Appalled at her Brother
It's getting lonelier for Boris Johnson. First his younger brother left the cabinet, and now his sister is castigating the Prime Minister's warlike language as "tasteless." She says he's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation," "fraud," "treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and arming himself more and more—at least verbally. During the time of questioning in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was met with massive outrage from the opposition, and since then many additional critics have weighed in: Dozens of bishops, and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The famous journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News that her brother used words like "capitulation," as though the opponents of the withdrawal from the EU "should be hanged, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She feels that is thoroughly reprehensible. She no longer recognizes this version of her brother, said Rachel Johnson, who stood for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK" during the elections for the EU parliament.
She was especially upset that her brother mentioned Jo Cox, an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who was murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum on the withdrawal. One can best honor her memory by carrying out Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. "It is in very poor taste to refer to a delegate who was murdered by someone shouting ‘Britain first,'" Johnson's sister is now critically asserting. The culprit is said to have obviously come from the extreme right wing, which feels itself strengthened "by this type of language." For all those who are mourning her, it's extremely tasteless.
And Cox's widower also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "Feel a bit sick at Jo's name being used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonize the other side." He also lamented that an atmosphere has arisen in which attacks have become more probable.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned his position as Minister of State and his mandate as the Tory delegate. "In recent weeks I've been torn between family loyalty and the national interest – it's an unresolvable tension," Jo Johnson said to justify the step he was taking.
Johnson's speech was met with strong criticism, including in the church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticized the speech, which they said was "not worthy of our country." In a joint statement, they declared: "In the last few days, the use of language, both in debates and outside parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak to others with respect.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
For its 100th anniversary, the NFL is giving a clear signal: Two women with Latin roots will perform at the upcoming Super Bowl halftime show. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will provide the halftime show at the upcoming final game of the NFL American football league. This was announced by organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to be next to J. Lo, representing the Latino community that is such an important force in the United States," Shakira shared in a video.
The finale of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, takes places February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, while Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican descent.
"I love that the Super Bowl has two women performing this year—and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she had huge hits like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also does work as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers," in German theaters from November.
Shakira was famous in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and a singer. She made her international debut in 2001 with her first dual language album and the single "Whenever, Wherever."
The halftime guest announcement is always hotly anticipated in the US. This year, many see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least due to the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is both the largest US sporting event and a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars, and the Rolling Stones have caused a huge stir there. More than 100 million TV viewers normally watch the NFL final, and it has become quite popular in Germany as well.
The runup to last year's game was mired in political controversy. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during the playing of the national anthem in protest against police violence against black people - he was then attacked harshly by US President Donald Trump and others. Some musicians refused a Super Bowl appearance out of solidarity with Kaepernick, including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was ultimately criticized by many for performing.
An actor and YouTuber badgers Egypt's ruler: For now Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have a say about whether blood will be spilt on Egypt's streets again, have both spent the past week abroad. One of the two drifted into Cairo airport again on Friday. State president Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 deposed Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely chosen head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York. US president Donald Trump had praised al-Sisi's action against political Islam, making no mention of the human rights violations on the Nile—during a week, when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. He had "no grounds for worry," al-Sisi said at the airport into the state television broadcasting microphone. "Egyptians are not easily misled."
Misleading—according to the president, is what the other man, who currently determines the events taking place on the streets, is doing. Mohamed Ali naturally stayed, where he keeps out of reach of the security forces, which would immediately arrest him if he tries to set foot in Egypt again. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known to only a minority of Egyptians as an actor. Today he is the leading voice commanding political discourse in cafes, living rooms and tea lounges across the country. With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets," Ali calls on countrymen to rise up against al-Sisi.
He addresses the state president in direct and country-style language. While the people are hungry, the president indulges in luxury and has new palaces built, is what the saying goes. The army leadership on which Sisi rests his rule accuses Ali of corruption and wealth grabbing. Because his second job as building contractor for 15 years meant he did business with precisely this man, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about—at least that is what many Egyptians believe, as the downright exploding clicks show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since al-Sisi's tightening grip, and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures in civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians were arrested, Ali called on a "Millions March" this Friday. That many people daring to go in the street seemed unlikely. But there have been isolated protests, for example Giseh in Cairo as well as in the Kina region near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, the participants of which blamed Al-Sisi corruption and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could initially not be identified. From security circles it was said, that the police ended the protests.
There were reports of high police presence in the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta last Friday, where last week demonstrators were tearing up banners with the portrait of the president. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and at exit roads. In Cairo several underground stations in the inner city were closed due to "maintenance work," most roads around Tahrir square, the heart of the revolution of 2011 were blocked off. And on the Rabaa square, on which in 2013 followers of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi entrenched themselves, until the army put them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure is meant to deter dissatisfied people from gathering. It is in this very place, that al-Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a large rally for the president.
These precautions prompted Mohamed Ali to change his tactic. "Our goal must not be Tahrir square," Ali said in Barcelona into his video camera. "Let us not come to knocks with police officers." But that should not be understood as a withdrawal. "All of Egypt is Tahrir square."
When the provider promises too much
If the internet connection seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways to make sure.
When signing a contract, one should not have to trust their provider blindly. If problems occur, customers can check the actual internet speed themselves.
The data transfer rates promised in advance are an important part of the contract and should therefore be reached, explains the Bavarian Consumer Center.
If the connection seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways to make sure. The measuring tools by the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them to the rates agreed upon in the contract.
"The provider checks are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", stated the Bavarian Consumer Center.
If the connection is much slower than agreed upon, customers can set the provider a reasonable deadline, which is usually 14 days, to provide the service as promised. The customers can do this per post, via a registered letter.
Should this prove unsuccessful after several attempts, customers can terminate their contracts and, in come circumstances, claim damages. Legal action can be used if all else fails.
Senior Republican for investigation
A senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont, has spoken out in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures—impeachment proceedings can lead to the removal of the President—were taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelation that Trump had made repeated requests over the phone to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate interventions by Democratic Presidential rival and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far withheld their criticism of Trump due to the whistleblower affair; few have shown unease about it. Scott's statements are the first sign of uneasiness within Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already pushed back against Trump's policies numerous times, such as when he opposed relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration requirements.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Additional Marvel film planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would be going their separate ways in the future. As a result, Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the Avengers universe. It was entirely unclear how the films starring Tom Holland would proceed.
Now the surprise: After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home," Spider-Man is getting an additional final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The same news was reported by several US media outlets. According to these reports, the cinema release is also set: The movie will be shown in the US from July 16, 2021.
The magazine Screenrant quotes Marvel boss Kevin Feige as saying, "I'm happy that Spidey's path continues on in the MCU. I and everyone else at Marvel Studios are absolutely delighted to be able to work on it again... He's the only superhero with the ability to take part in different universes, as Sony continues to work on its Spidey-Verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But where did the sudden good news come from? Sony has allegedly made Marvel an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would be given a 30 per cent share in the proceeds from the upcoming Spider-Man films. This news has not been confirmed, however.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry Appear in "Suits" Finale
After nine seasons, the American series "Suits" has reached its grand finale. The last episode contained many happy endings and cameos. And a charming tribute was paid to the royal couple, Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had taken part in the series for years. Note: The following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan does not return in the finale for one last farewell as Rachel Zane—at least not for new scenes. Instead, a few looks back presented the most memorable scenes with the current duchess once more. Like the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike, or how she greeted him after he had served his sentence.
But her real-life husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in passing in the "Suits" finale (in a wedding scene, naturally). Just as Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) was going to the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) made a telling comment regarding his suit. The confused Harvey wants to know whether or not the bridegroom had actually thrown on a frock coat, only to then make the snarky comment: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
The Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a refugee boat overturned on the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the accident, the Greek coastguard announced Friday. Their nationalities have not been established yet.
The boat sank off the Greek island of Oinousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women, and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing over from Turkey to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. According to figures from UNHCR, 174 people died along this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now said he intends to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU commissioner, Seehofer wants to "find out about the situation with refugees" in Turkey, he said on Friday. Afterwards, in Athens, he wants to learn more about "the administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to be able to help overcome them.
On Friday, an EU Commission spokesperson confirmed Seehofer's planned visit with EU Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner.
An extraordinarily high number of migrants from Turkey are continuing to arrive in Greece. 654 people landed on the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection reported on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers have recently cast doubts over the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement reached in 2016. Under this agreement, the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who have come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, for every Syrian sent back, the EU agreed to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey.
However, the processing of asylum applications on the Greek side is proceeding sluggishly due to personnel shortages. The Ministry of Civil Protection says that almost 29,400 people are trapped on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros, and Kos. The situation on Lesbos is the most serious: A camp with a capacity for 650 people is currently accommodating 5,200 migrants.
Never since the EU-Turkey refugee agreement came into force in March 2016 have there been so many, according to the state radio broadcaster.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the healthcare system to the test in the future. Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Cardiology Association, says that changes to the climate will "certainly" be one of the greatest challenges to the healthcare system during the next twenty to fifty years. High temperatures and extreme temperature changes primarily stress the cardiovascular system and lead increasingly to heart attacks. Those most affected include people with cardiovascular disease, the elderly, and diabetics.
The Green politician must answer for an embarrassing photo accident
Elisabeth May, the leader of the Green Party of Canada—Was the cup edited for this reason?
The leader of the Green Party of Canada holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. However, it has not come out: The cup was edited.
Ottawa/Canada—It has gone unnoticed for a long time, but was finally discovered. Elisabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Green Party, never had the reusable coffee cup with the metal straw in her hand. The photograph on the party´s website showed May holding the cup and talking to the voters. However, the photo had been published and distributed to the media before—and the cup used to be a crude (paper) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
The Green Party leader must answer for the photo
The National Post accused May of manipulation and stated that the party was spreading fake news in order to appear more credible regarding "environmental protection". And that in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, as Trudeau has also been dealing with difficulties because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked discussion on fake news. A user shared a comparison of the two photos and wrote: "The Green party edited a photograph of its leader to hide a single-use coffee cup".
May seemed shocked and claimed not to have known anything about this on her blog. For emphasis, she posted the original photograph: Herself, speaking to the voters, coffee cup in hand. The cup is, however, made of bamboo. She always carries it with her. A spokeswoman for the party claimed that the goal was to add the party logo to the photo, and not to conceal anything. A part of the photo can still be found on the party website.
May wrote she felt sorry for the employee who did it. "I do not want to say he is stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she said to the Guardian and addressed her overly committed team: "If you intend to edit a photograph, would it be possible to edit my face so that I look younger?"
The German Green party also had to deal with shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic and of air travel—but their pictures were not photoshopped. The leader of the Bavarian Green party Katharina Schulze, ate her ice cream with a plastic spoon on vacation, as merkur.de reports.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Life-long ban from Cathay
Jaqueline Ng had apparently received mail from Cathay Pacific confirming an upgrade. But when she asked about it at check-in, she was not allowed on board—and she can never fly with Cathay again.
Many passengers dream of being spontaneously upgraded to business class. Sometimes they are lucky and check-in employees offer to switch them from economy class.
This case shows, however, how not do it: A self-declared influencer actively requested a free upgrade from airline Cathay Pacific. More than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng on Instagram. On May 30, she flew from Taiwan to New York, returning on June 7.
On her outbound flight, employees refused to give Jaqueline an upgrade even though she showed them an email stating Cathay Pacific had allegedly promised her an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the message from a marketing employee at the airline. However, the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the email.
On her return flight, Jaqueline again tried to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. The woman is alleged to have presented the email this time as well, but with a different reference number. Employees at JFK Airport were skeptical. They contacted their head office and dug a little deeper. As it turns out, the employee from whom the email is said to have originated denied writing to Jaqueline. The email system also confirmed this, as the messages were not found.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jacqueline's ticket and hit her with a life-long flying ban from Cathay Pacific. She was forced to purchase a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400 (around €1,280).
The influencer took her case to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jacqueline also wanted the costs of the new ticket home.
However, unless Jaqueline submits the email metadata, the case is clear: As far as Cathay is concerned, the influencer has committed fraud; she will remain banned from future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jacqueline is not satisfied—and is now seeking an attorney.
Oil prices fall after report of a ceasefire in Yemen
On Friday afternoon, oil prices fell rapidly by over one dollar. A barrel (159 liters) of North Sea Brent oil ultimately cost $61.83—down about 1.4 per cent on the previous day. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 per cent to $55.77.
The fall was triggered by a report in the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen, Saudi Arabia is reported to have agreed to a ceasefire in four regions.
A drone attack on oil refineries in Saudi Arabia in the middle of September had paralyzed 5 per cent of world oil output. In civil war-torn Yemen, the Huthi rebels allied with Iran claimed responsibility for the attacks Like the US Government, Saudi Arabia blames Iran. A ceasefire would ease the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, focus can be centered on problems with growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy section at the Bloomberg news agency's Saxo Bank.
Oil prices are therefore continuing the downward trend of the last few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil still cost almost $59, and a barrel of Brent almost $65.
Citing insiders, Bloomberg reported recently that the repairs to the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia after the attack were proceeding faster than expected. According to this source, output is said to have again reached 8 million barrels per day and is heading back to its original level.
There have been several press reports recently referring to insiders and talking of rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in carrying out the repairs. But commodities experts claimed that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock market flotation and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there has been an easing of tension in the conflict between Iran and the West. After being held by the Iranians for more than two months and recently released, British oil tanker the Stena Impero is about to leave harbor. The crew are now preparing for departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping company boss Erik Hånell told Swedish radio in a text message Friday morning.
Nevertheless, the United States said it would deploy missiles and troops against its Iranian archenemy to Saudi Arabia. Fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had driven oil prices upwards in recent weeks, at times significantly.
Accusations against Trump intensify
Accusations of a cover-up by the White House have been voiced in the affair regarding US president Donald Trump's possible abuse of power, After a contentious telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Selenskyi at the end of July, several leading government employees worked feverishly to prevent access to the transcript of the call. This was reported by an anonymous informer. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, explicitly accused the White House of a "cover-up". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea considers a third summit for Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute is likely to lead to a third summit for rulers Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump soon. The meaning and the chances of success of such a meeting are doubtful due to a lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, according to top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan via the KCNA agency.
So far, the USA have not done anything to implement last year's summit's decisions, the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs advisor said. He also criticized tighter sanctions and common military maneuvers of the USA and South Korea. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "brave" decision by Trump, so that things can become closer again.
On Monday, Trump had said that he first wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would entail, before declaring himself prepared for it. The negotiations for a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed summit for Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June both met in the demilitarized zone between both the Korean states. Here they agreed to revive consultations, so far without success.
Prinz Harry: Weapons manufacturers are to assist with mine clearance
Wearing a blue protective jacket, British prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed a blast mine in Angola. He made the ignition circle near a camp run by the British Halo Trust in the Dirico area. The explosive device detonated at a safe distance. With a view to making Angola mine-free by 2025, he later made a request in front of running TV cameras. "I am calling on all countries, the names on which are written on these weapons, but which have not assisted in clearance, to make a commitment to help."
Pound under pressure—Drop in interest rates expected
British pound under pressure
With a fall in interest rates imminent, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Speculation in Frankfurt over an imminent fall in Bank of England (BoE) interest rates is punishing sterling. On Friday, the British currency fell by 0.4 percent to $1.2269
on the back of remarks by Michael Saunders of the Bank of England. He talked of a potential fall in interest rates even though a chaotic Brexit had been avoided, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. His remark was a surprise because Saunders is considered an advocate of restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the ActivTrades brokerage firm.
Last week, the Bank of England had referred to the economic burden resulting from the wrangling over Brexit, without directly mentioning a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU on October 31, without a withdrawal agreement if necessary.
And with his provocations, the British prime minister has run a great risk. But it could pay off, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analysis lab has been manipulated, confirms David Howman, the former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and now the Athletics Integrity Unit Chair of The International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF).
At the start of the Athletics World Championships, new details about the doping scandal in Russia have come to light, and they destroy even the small degree of credibility that Russian sports had won back at the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow doping lab finally delivered to the WADA the requested samples from 2012 to 2015. As it now turns out: They were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. After that, the WADA blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee allowed around 270 athletes to compete under a neutral flag in the 2016 Summer games in Rio, after individual testing, and 168 Russian athletes were there at the start of the Winter Games in February 2018. And they were allowed to compete in various world cups: In the summer, even the Soccer World Cup took place in Russia, with the hosts participating.
Positive Findings Lacking
In the following September, the WADA lifted the RUSADA ban, but demanded access to the lab and said samples. The data was to provide information on the scope of the coverup of doping cases in the nation. They were to help penalize athletes after the fact. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chair of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed, however, that the doping data from the Moscow analysis lab were manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We were to check whether the task force obtained the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data the WADA obtained from a whistleblower and those they had received in January from the Russians." Many positive findings that had been allegedly mentioned in the McLaren Report were lacking.
World Cup Unaffected
This was confirmed by the behavior of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation was the only organization to hold onto the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they trained outside the Russian system and undergo testing.
At the start of that week, the WADA had already raised the question of the manipulations and demanded that Russia answer the charges within three weeks. Russia was now threatened with the renewed block of RUSADA and, in the worst-case scenario, exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo as well.
Fire in French chemical plant extinguished
A major fire in a chemical plant regarded as especially dangerous, in the northern French town of Rouen, has been put out. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out in the early hours of Thursday. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire service was at the scene with around 200 fire engines.
Fire prevented from spreading
Locals were called upon not to leave their houses. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, with schools and kindergartens remaining closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant located on the banks of the river Seine, lubricant additives are produced. The factory belongs to US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol group and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso directives, which prescribe especially strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has also made headlines in the past - such as in 2013 when the gas methanethiol leaked out, causing an extensive area to smell of rotten eggs. After an accident in 2015, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil leaked out into the town's sewage system.
Woman Quits Her Job to Search for Her Lost Dog for 57 Days
A woman from Washington searched for her lost dog for two months – and quit her job for that reason alone. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run away from a hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. There was no trace of her for 57 days – but Carole King did not give up.
“It was horrible. I felt sick.” Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left their dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they came back, Katie was gone. They looked for the animal, but to no avail.
Thunder had made the dog panic
Hoping that Katie could still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception desk. “The employee said that she had left about four to four and a half hours ago,” Carole told the Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran outside immediately. Presumably loud thunder had made the dog panic.
The Kings searched for their beloved dog with fliers and posts in Facebook groups. But days turned into weeks. “I never gave up. I never lost hope.” Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
Tears flowed
57 days after Katie’s disappearance, Carole King received a call: a man contacted her and said that Katie was in his yard. By the time King arrived, however, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was there, under a tree. “I just held her in my arms. I didn’t want to let her go.” King remembered, according to the Daily Inter Lake. “Tears flowed. People stopped their cars, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her.”
Losses at the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still not been found.
In recent years the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. These include three machine guns. In most cases, their whereabouts still remain unknown. The opposition has described the extent as "worrying".
Weapons and ammunition disappear repeatedly from the Bundeswehr - much thus far without a trace. Since the start of 2014, troops registered the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This has emerged from a listing categorized as classified information by the federal ministry of defense, as reported by the German Editor Network RND.
According to the paper from the office of the state defense secretary, CDU Bundestag member Peter Tauber, two weapons, one weapon part and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have thus far turned up. Amongst the weapons and parts still not found there were six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols as well as two P8 pistols. A further 30 gun barrels for MG3 machine guns are also missing.
How arms and ammunition loss is handled at the Bundeswehr is "worrying", said Martina Renner, a Bundestag member for the party Die Linke. This all the more so as during investigations "barely anything" had been retrieved. The politician for Die Linke spoke of a "meager total". Renner criticized that the listing did not reveal whether the listing of missing ammunition included they type found in the possession of Franco A., the Bundeswehr officer under suspicion of terrorism. "And this although a supporter of Franco A. had recently been found guilty of being in possession of this ammunition", Renner said.
Oil Tanker Stena Impero Leaves Iranian Port
Today, Friday, more than two months after it was detained by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker Stena Impero left the port of the city Bandar Abbas. As ship-tracking data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker was set in motion and left the Iranian port. The stated port of destination was Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday already, but it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company stated that it wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The Stena Impero was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of having violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to Britain’s controversial temporary seizure of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, which belongs to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important waterways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of global oil exports is shipped through the Strait. The tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Teheran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel praises the courage of the people during the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the courage of the people in the GDR who took to the streets during the Peaceful Revolution 30 years ago. In the fall of 1989 brave citizens made the GDR regime falter, Merkel said during a ceremonial act of the parliamentary group of the Thuringian CDU for the German Unity Day in Erfurt. The chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. “The terror of the state security service has been stripped away”, she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla’s quarter might break record. The electric car group experienced losses despite delivery boom.
New York. With the prospect of record numbers, Tesla head Elon Musk caused his electric car company's stock to boom. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries”, Musk wrote in an email for Tesla employees published by the business blog “Electrek”.
Musk’s message continued that the demand is so high Tesla could book 110,000 orders. The challenge is now to swiftly deliver the cars to customers. For that Tesla needs to raise as much resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Tesla’s stocks finished with an increase of over six percent. The price had not increased this much for almost four months. Tesla delivered around 95,000 cars in the second quarter and with that reached its current record level.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. He wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars in 2019. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter. Especially in demand is the cheap Tesla Model 3 but the profit margins are small. Despite the boom there have been losses recently.
Mystery Solved: Why We Cannot Tickle Ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Researchers from the Humboldt University in Berlin came to this conclusion after experimenting with rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. There has also been progress on answering the question of why children resist tickling so fiercely, but then demand for more.
Finally, it has been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone already triggers laughter. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum which triggers laughter as soon as tickles are expected.
According to the information, earlier research showed how rats react with laughter in the ultrasonic range when they are tickled by humans. This “laughter” is being transmitted via the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed when you touch yourself
So far it has been assumed that the brain can differentiate between self-touch and touch by others – that is why humans cannot tickle themselves. But the Berlin researchers have found out in experiments on rats that laughter, as well as the activity in the corresponding area of the cerebral cortex, are suppressed during self-touching. This is also the case when animals clean themselves. However, during the touching and tickling by the researchers, brain activity and the impulse to laugh are amplified.
But if self-touch and touch by others occur at the same time, laughter is suppressed as well. This suggests that rats' brains cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new findings also suggest that humans cannot tickle themselves because of a brake in the cerebrum that is activated through self-touch.
The rats themselves had also been trained to initiate tickling. They sometimes discontinued this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showing flight behavior or fright rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to children's behavior. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster Avoided: Major Fire in French Chemical Plant Extinguished
The major fire in a chemical plant regarded as particularly hazardous in the northern French town of Rouen has been extinguished, as the prefecture of Normandy informed the news agency AFP. The fire started Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no harmful materials escaped. Samples taken give no cause for concern, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said in the course of a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department deployed around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Local residents were requested to stay at home. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, and schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to US billionaire Warren Buffet’s company Lubrizol and is subject to what is known as the Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly stringent safety requirements. Approximately 400 people work at the factory.
The chemical plant has hit the headlines in the past – for instance in 2013, when there was a leakage of the gas methanethiol and the extended surroundings smelled of rotten eggs. After an industrial accident in 2015, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The prime minister Boris Johnson's sister commented on his speech on Wednesday evening's first parliamentary session since the lifting of the prorogation of parliament. The prime minister threatened to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without a deal if Brussels would not go along with his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he intends to achieve this remains unclear.
With regard to Cox, who had campaigned for Great Britain to remain within the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country will be to conclude withdrawal from the EU." Cox was murdered back in 2016 by a rightwing extremist during the referendum campaign.
Monument to attacks in Oslo and Utöya unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 fatalities, a monument in memory of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument Jernrosene (English: Iron Roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose reproductions. They recall the thousands of roses that were placed in front of the cathedral in Oslo in the days and weeks after the attacks.
At the same location, the project created by the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are also expected to attend.
On July 22, 2011 the rightwing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in Oslo's government district, before shooting dozens of people at a youth organization camp belonging to the Social Democrat Workers' Party on the island of Utöyan. In the attacks, a total of 77 people were killed.
Iran Releases British Oil Tanker
The UN general debate failed to resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker Stena Impero, detained in Iran, was able to set sail again. This could be a piece of the puzzle on Iranian President Rouhani’s road map for peace.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, detained since mid-July in the Strait of Hormuz, is back in international waters. The ship is on its way to Dubai after being released by the Iranian authorities, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas, and the crew is now sailing to Dubai for medical checkups, among other things, explained shipping company boss Erik Hånell. The ship left Iranian waters around noon. "It's good that it’s over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Foreign Office in London proclaimed the detainment of the ship to be illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the tanker on July 19th on charges of having violated maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. All things considered, the remaining 16 crew members were doing well, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and stressful situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is working toward reuniting them with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected that the Stena Impero was detained in response to a similar incident in Gibraltar: at the beginning of July, an Iranian supertanker with oil supposedly destined for Syria had been detained there. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against war-torn Syria. The British had received a tip-off about the ship from the United States.
Iran declared this "piracy" and threatened that there would be consequences. The Adrian Darya-1 was eventually released in mid-August. London vehemently rejected speculation that it was an quid-pro-quo to get the Stena Impero released.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. The majority of global oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have increased drastically in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Driving the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies this. In 2018, the USA unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear agreement intended to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb and simultaneously end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter agreement, extending over more areas. Iran has withstood the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute about the Stena Impero and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the United States are working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a road map for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States, but without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is blocking a better future for itself with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war profiteer". With the punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese manufacturers by American president Donald Trump, foreign manufacturers in the People's Republic are finding themselves forced to relocate. In a UBS survey, financial heads of Asian firms considering moving production out of China to another country, name India as one of their preferred alternatives. This admittedly is not only related to the vagaries in the Chinese-American trade war. Having a giant pool of young labor and a domestic market with 1.3 billion consumers, India seems ideally situated to play a more important role in the globally spread-out manufacturing chain.
However, India now finds itself in Trump's sights. It was derogatorily called "Kingdom of Tariffs" by the swashbuckler in the White House, and America withdrew preferential trading on 2,000 products from the developing country at the beginning of June. The USA accuses India of having prohibitively high tariffs and is demanding improved market access for agricultural goods, mobile telephones, spirits, motorcycles, and much more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India is admittedly a side theater. Further, America also views the world's largest democracy through the prism of security politics. Delhi and Washington share concerns over China's military intentions in the southern Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's prime minister Narendra Modi, who has just commenced his second term in office, may therefore feel safe.
The problem meanwhile lies elsewhere: the empirically substantiated theory that open markets accelerate economic development has a hard time in the socialist republic of India - even under Modi. His reformatory zeal is aimed primarily at the bureaucratic madness which has long stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multiethnic state. Companies now receive building permits more quickly; they benefit from improvements to energy and transportation infrastructure. At the same time a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law lays the foundations for all-but-dead and highly indebted companies to be liquidated more swiftly.
The success achieved with these efforts is impressive and can be measured by the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India during the first five Modi years. Yet this is not the case in trade politics. Inspired by wanting to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from overseas competitors, the national-conservative government has even created new hurdles.
In the West, Modi has the mystique of the energetic reformer who is subjecting his country to radical economic renewal. This impression is not least a result of the charismatic prime minister knowing all too well what language western managers like. However, at heart the "India First" advocate has never moved away from protectionist economic policies, holding back Indian companies from being forced to abandon anachronistic processes and thus becoming fit for global competition. Businesspeople who survive thanks to their branches being protected are among the core voters for Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French president Jacques Chirac is due to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, the news agency AFP reported, according to Chirac’s family. The funeral will take place with immediate family. According to media reports, a public funeral service at the Dôme des Invalides in Paris was scheduled for Sunday.
Carried the competitor to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championship in Athletics
The best of the best had already reached the finish when a heartwarming scene took place in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first preliminary heat of the men's 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to stagger dangerously. He could barely stay on his feet some 300 meters before the finish line and ran in an unhealthy, stooped posture when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly linked arms and supported him the last half lap to the finish line. But both of them still had enough power to stop their watches after finishing the race, as if the scene was not curious enough already.
“I just wanted to help him. Everybody in this situation would have done the same”, Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly gained the attention of the present journalists. First he shyly evaded and didn’t even want to talk about his heroic deed. After all, he wanted to set his personal record, and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow in misery. And besides, he is just proud to represent his country, which was invited to the Championship by the World Association. Under normal circumstances he would not even be allowed to participate. “That’s why I’m proud to race for my country”, he stated.
That he did empathically in the evening – and way more intensive than he expected. This heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo gave way to his competitor Busby and voluntarily made last place – by the way some five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary. It didn’t help in the end, since Busby reached the finish line only with a lot of help and was disqualified by the World Athletic Association because of that.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, had started in order to set a personal record in the Word Championship. That succeeded, according to official data, with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was disappointed nonetheless. “I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I already was under 18 minutes,” but only during practice, where records do not count.
March of millions: Egyptians prepare for a wild day of protests
Security measures in Egypt have been reinforced prior to possible protests crticizing the government. Increased police presence has been observed in downtown Cairo. Several subway stations stayed closed. Streets surrounding the central Tahrir Square have been blocked.
In the past few days police already increased roadside checks and cell phones of pedestrians have been searched for messages and pictures regarding the protests. Hundreds have been arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of el-Sisi
Protests with hundreds of participants took place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansoura over the past weekend. They were aimed at the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who is being accused of corruption and mismanagement. There has been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt in years. Mohammed Ali, an Egyptian developer and actor who lives in exile in Spain, set off the protests with video messages on Facebook and called for a march of millions on central plazas in the country. Ali demanded a People’s revolution. Although not considered “one of the good guys” by most young Egyptians because he earned millions as a subcontractor for the army, his messages have reach.
The numbers of arrests connected to the protests increases further, according to two watch groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR), as well as the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of over 2,000 arrests. It was not possible to confirm the numbers independently. The government neither confirmed nor commented on the numbers.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been “arrested arbitrarily just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time”, HRW stated, according to the lawyers of arrested Egyptians. The lawyers have stated the accusations reach from “spreading false information” to “membership in a terrorist organization”. Security forces in uniform and plain clothes searched and questioned pedestrians in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, according to HRW information.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country as the government in Cairo has blocked websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Retailers: Mail-Order Companies Should be Allowed to Donate Returns More Easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up as trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned goods instead of destroying them.
Although it is impossible to exempt companies from VAT on donations in kind, retailers could set the market value of unsaleable returns so low that they would need to pay no or only very little VAT, the Ministry explained in response to a question from the Greens parliamentary group, as reported in newspapers of the Funke media group on Friday.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that Germans return every sixth parcel ordered via the internet. Around four percent of the goods – roughly 20 million products – ended as trash. Donating them would cost companies additional money, according to current laws, because the tax authorities treat donations in kind as revenue, on which VAT is due.
Katrin Göring-Eckhardt, head of the Green parliamentary group, has urged Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree that companies can declare products unsaleable and donate them to charitable organizations free of charge. Companies must be able to rely on not being penalized for donations. This should not apply to online retail only, but also to other businesses ranging from fashion shops to hardware stores.
Banksy art under the hammer: Never a better moment to sell this painting
The famous work by street art star Banksy, Devolved Parliament, is to be auctioned shortly.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the degeneration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world, into an attitude characterized by animals and tribes." The painting will be on display starting Saturday at Sotheby's in the British capital until its auction on October 3rd. Its value is estimated at between 1.5 and 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist has had the painting on display again - at the same time as the original Brexit date, March 29. To mark the occasion, the work, formerly titled Question Time, was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change hands for a multimillion sum.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has had a feisty exchange with the opposition at the first parliamentary session after the lifting of Johnson's parliamentary prorogation by the supreme court on Wednesday. Johnson wants to conclude the twice-postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has gotten involved in the Brexit debate. In Southeast England's Dover he painted a picture depicting a man breaking one of the European flag's stars with a chisel. The work is seen daily by thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors as they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit Debate Is Like a “Walk in the Park”
The hefty verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson against Brexit-opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the campaign leading up to the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” said Daniel Cummings on Friday at a book launch. “We’re enjoying this, we’re going to win, we’re going to leave (the EU).”
In the past few days, Johnson had vehemently attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament and, among other things, accused them of “betrayal” of the people. The accusations that this could endanger parliamentarians, because they might be targeted by death threats, he called “humbug”.
Cummings said that in the end the situation could only be resolved by Parliament honoring its promise to respect the result. It was not surprising that some people are angry about that fact that Great Britain has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In light of the charged atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican church called for moderation on Friday. “We should speak to others with respect,” they stated. “And we should also listen.”
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan Demands UN Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional plea, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, during his first appearance at the UN General Assembly, once again requested the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India was probable, Khan said on Friday during the UN general debate in New York. “If this goes badly, hope for the best but be prepared for the worst”. The United Nations carried responsibility for Kashmir. “You should have prevented this.”
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers rule over a part of Kashmir; another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn its autonomous status from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby suddenly increasing tensions in its relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo call for the overthrow of Egyptian President el-Sisi
The government reacts with an iron fist to the protests in Egypt. It unleashed live ammunition on the population. Over 2,000 arrested are joining the 60,000 political prisoners that are already being held in prisons. It was never harmless to protest in Egypt, but since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013 the state apparatus works tirelessly to avoid a similar scenario to the Arab Spring.
One of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Propelled by poverty, lack of perspectives, and the feeling of being stifled by the government, millions took to the streets. This is a problem that cannot be handled, no matter how hard el-Sisi’s regime is acting against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.
Every third Egyptian lives below the poverty line. The currency lost more than half of its value since 2016; the inflation rate is at ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the super market has to decide whom to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, soccer stadiums, produces food and a lot more. This had already been the case before el-Sisi. The people have a lot of experience with autocratic regimes; the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one as well. But if the majority of the people have difficulty affording a bottle of water, then it becomes critical.
Tüv technical tests in terminal: Berlin Airport chief: no more “showstoppers” for capital’s airport
Tests have been ongoing for two months to see whether BER’s complex fire protection equipment network works in harmony. The operators expressed satisfaction with the progress, but the technical testing is not yet over for BER.
After large-scale Tüv technical testing in the capital’s future airport terminal, the operators confirmed the airport’s opening planned for October next year. This is certain, said supervisory board chairman Rainer Bretschneider following a meeting of the supervisory body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of the test’s successful conclusion, but also said there were still deficiencies to be resolved in the terminal. “We have many minor details but no genuine showstopper.” He offered assurance that the timetable leading to the opening still allowed breathing space.
There were however indications that the time reserves may not be especially large. The notice of building completion will be sent to the building department in the course of the first quarter of 2020; at the start of this year it had been foreseen for this fall.
Hundreds of issues with electricity cables are still to be sorted out; the Tüv intends to examine these by February. “In order to lay the foundations for commencing air operations, further work on resolving the issues is required," according to a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it was a matter of missing certificates rather than new cables. There also is still no clearance for all screw anchors from which the cable trays are suspended. The airport chief expects these to be available by the end of the year.
Furthermore, fire protection is not yet working satisfactorily at the transition to the station under the terminal. The problems had led the project into a further crisis three years ago. This time issues relate to smoke curtains which in the event of fire are lowered like a canvas screen to prevent smoke from spreading. They currently come down too far. 36 motors therefore require replacement before new tests with hot gas smoke take place at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects and planning errors have delayed the airport’s inauguration for years. It should originally have gone into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, costs have risen from two billion to an expected 6.5 billion euros by next year’s opening.
As passenger numbers in Berlin have since risen considerably, those in charge are planning an expansion to the airport. This will be the subject under discussion at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board on October 18, as announced by chairman Bretschneider.
The airport operator is now looking for two new business heads. According to Bretschneider, the head of finance Heike Fölster is moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, while head of personnel Manfred Bobke-von Camen is retiring next year. He thanked Fölster, who had put airport finances onto “a firm footing.”
Chemnitz: Vending machines blown up for Drugs – Man arrested by police
He needed money for drugs – and blew up several vending and parking machines in the Chemnitz downtown area! Now he’s finally in custody!
During the last two years the number of busted cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and its region increased drastically causing millions in damages.
After two detonations at Bürger street and Further street in Chemnitz in late May, the police arrested a 33 year old German.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "During the investigation by the Chemnitz criminal police concerning the explosions in concomitance with grand larceny, these suspicions of the 33 year old have been more than confirmed.”
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33 year old Chemnitz citizen admitted to a total of eight crimes.
The police spokesman: "Apparently he funded his narcotics addiction through theft.” Between August 20th, 2018 and May 31st, 2019, the bomber blew up four parking ticket machines along the Bürger street.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000€!
The machine bomber is now in police custody. The criminal investigations against him continue.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further machine detonations in Chemnitz and the surrounding counties.
AUA Takes Over Eurowings Flights From Vienna
The Lufthansa group is revamping its strategy for Vienna International Airport. In the midst of the price war among budget airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is assuming “the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna,” an Austrian Airlines press officer confirmed to APA yesterday. There had been previous reports to that effect by “AviationNetOnline”.
This is the de facto end of the Vienna base of the Lufthansa budget airline Eurowings. Four of the present seven Eurowings airplanes will remain in Vienna. AUA is “wet leasing” these as of January 2020, i.e., leasing them with the Eurowings personnel. Three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, flying as chartered planes to holiday destinations from Salzburg and Innsbruck. Eurowings Germany is taking over the routes from Vienna to Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the press officer explained. Flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The goal is to strengthen the Vienna hub on one hand and to expand decentralized traffic from the federal provinces on the other.
AviationNetOnline writes that Eurowings will only serve as a “production company” for its sister company AUA. Thus, flights to Barcelona and Rome will be flying under AUA flight numbers, but operated by Eurowings units. Although the in-flight product will be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants will come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight numbers will no longer be dispatched from Terminal 1, but from Terminal 3 like Austrian Airlines.
A price war has erupted at Vienna International Airport following the bankruptcy of Niki. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion just announced on Thursday that they are bumping up the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish budget airline is sending four Ryanair planes and their crews to Vienna, also under what is known as “wet lease”. This has been criticized by the trade union as an attempt to circumvent the collective agreement.
Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary asserted that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years. To this challenge, AUA board member Andreas Otto countered on Friday: “We will remain the number one at this location, be it in five, six or ten years.”
The Queen’s Granddaughter Princess Beatrice Is Betrothed
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now, the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is betrothed!
Wonderful news from the British royals: on vacation in Italy earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) proposed to his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the Palace on Thursday.
“We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement. We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can’t wait to be married,” said the couple in the official announcement. According to British media reports, they have been together since October 2018.
Further: “We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official pictures of the betrothal were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and published immediately on her Instagram account.
A royal celebration
The wedding is planned for 2020. More information about the date, venue and all other details will be disclosed by the Palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the wedding of ninth heir to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be as large a celebration as the wedding of Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank (32) on October 12, 2018.
Study on the Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating – there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes heart failure or heart attacks? Scientists from Hamburg want to have a closer look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and ill people.
Scientists from Hamburg and Switzerland want to understand the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail by analyzing the genetic material of 9,000 individuals.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, said the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is supporting the project with 12.5 million euros. In Switzerland, both the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are participating.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy eating are among the significant risk factors for cardio-vascular diseases that can be influenced. Genetic factors also determine the risk. However, too little is known about the interaction between genes and external influences, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genomes of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart & Vascular Center at the UKE.
At the moment, possible disease-causing changes of DNA - called mutations - are known for more than 4,000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes, says the Medical Center. Another 200 are added each year.
The goal of the five-year project, according to the initiators, is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also assist research into other widespread diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart & Vascular Center. It may be possible to gain new insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidneys and also into cancers.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that they firmly intend to use the data for research into other diseases as well. To date, the foundation’s clinic in Davos has primarily treated allergies. Now, on its medical campus, a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and chair for Bioinformatics are being established. Asked about the reasons for his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he underwent open-heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was deeply grateful.
The biospecimens of the healthy participants stem from the citizens of Hamburg who are also taking part in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 test subjects, this is the largest local health survey in the world, according to the Medical Center. The scientists assure that, in the decoding of the genome, strict attention is given to the protection of the anonymized data. A petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data are involved, says Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
The genetic material of a human can be decoded within 24 hours, according to the UKE. The pure material costs for that are around 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing in the world, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is planned to start on October 1st, and all 9,000 samples should already be analyzed by the end of 2020. First results are expected the following year.
Nigerian Police Rescue Hundreds of Abused Boys
The police in Nigeria have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Quran school. After receiving information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, police spokesman Yakuba Sabo said. "The victims were maltreated. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers." Sabo said.
The boys had been detained under the pretense of being taught and “reformed” in the Quran. In reality, the boys were held by the teachers in the “most degrading and inhumane conditions,” Sabo stated. Around one hundred students, including children of the age of nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information provided, the Quran School had existed for around ten years. Local residents had informed the authorities about repeated irregularities at the institution. The parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Quran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The principal and six employees have been arrested, according to the police.
There are many private Quran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed bandits. For that reason, according to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained up and tortured: Nigeria police free 400 children from school
Police have freed almost 400 children from appalling conditions in a school in the north of Nigeria. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries which pointed to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the town of Kaduna.
The children had been discovered on Thursday in an Islamic school after a tip-off. The conditions there had been "degrading." Officials arrested the school head and took six teachers into custody after the rescue operation.
The children, all boys, had been kept at their school "like slaves" and kept on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV pictures showed emaciated and injured schoolboys in visibly poor medical condition.
World Player Award: More Accusations After Triumph for Messi and Klopp
Soccer "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
At a gala in Milan, the World Football Association FIFA honored the best female player, male player, and coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth award and therefore a record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he never voted in the World Player selection, FIFA is receiving complaints from other countries. Egypt's vote was not counted at all – for a strange reason.
Much of FIFA's activity in recent years had proven to be disreputable: World Cup allocation, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infanto, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. So far, however, the FIFA World Player selection has not been under suspicion for being improper – apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains often vote based on sympathy rather than objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging. Egypt complained that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly accessible voting summary.
FIFA apologizes insofar as “the signatures on the voting form were written in capital letters and are therefore not valid”. The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation – with no response.
Sudan’s coach surprised as well
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in Egypt’s case is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote the way his vote was ultimately counted: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second, and Sadio Mané in third. According to FIFA, the votes were submitted exactly like that, with the signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera had also made allegations: “Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 awards. All information about my vote is false, thank you”, he wrote. It was speculated that in his case, the Nicaragua Football Association simply voted in his name.
The association announced on Friday: that was true, but it was not done on purpose, of course. The completed voting forms were “mistakenly” signed with the signature of Juan Barrera, Nicaragua’s captain, according to an announcement by the association. Technically, second captain Manuel Rosas had voted. “We take responsibility for the administrative error," the statement said. But both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte voted for Messi, “exactly how it is stated in the official FIFA list”.
FIFA is now having the other cases examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the voting process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. In the meantime, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Player election – and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine Affair: Senior Republicans Support Official Investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly declared themselves in favor of an official investigation against US president and fellow party member Donald Trump. “I think the inquiry is important,” said the Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. “Where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established.” He wanted to know more about the whistle-blower affair before taking action – impeachment proceedings can lead to the president being removed from office.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the disclosures. These revealed that, during a phone call, Trump had repeatedly urged the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to look into the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in the Ukraine. Trump has been watching Biden “over the years”.
To date, Republicans have been holding back on criticism of Trump in the whistle-blower affair; few have expressed their discomfort. Scott’s remarks are a first indication of unease in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump’s policies on several occasions, for instance, the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, is another senior Republican in favor of an investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation,” said Baker. “I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as Governors of US states, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which are decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore mostly of symbolic importance. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have begun to express criticism concerning the situation. Mitt Romney, for instance, who represents the state of Utah in the Senate, says the case is “extremely troubling, deeply troubling”. US media also report first signs of discord among Republicans.
The affair could lead to the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump. To this end, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse Trump of abusing his power to gain foreign interference for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats can initiate an impeachment. The decision on an actual conviction, however, is made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have a majority. The chances of success of such proceedings are therefore very small. So far no US president has ever been removed from office by impeachment proceedings.
Have there been torturers on board of Rackete’s Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily; they allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June, after heading for the harbor of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees on board, without proper permission. Her house arrest was lifted by an Italian judge, after strong protests and international criticism – also from Austrian president Alexander van der Bellen.
Now there are serious new allegations against Rackete. Case in point, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have reached Italy on the Sea Watch 3. The accused have been caught in Messina (Sicily), after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. “We can’t rule this out but don’t have any sure information either”, Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the Deutsche Presse Agentur.
According to the police, in mid-September the suspects raped, tortured, and murdered victims in the North African country. They are Mohammed C. (27) and two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). “The migrants have been systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities through repeated and constant physical violence”, according to the note back then.
NGO and aid agencies pointed out, that they cannot know exactly who boards their ships. “We cannot scan the people. They arrive without passports”, Neugebauer said. Torture may be one of the reasons why people flee from Libya. It is thus possible, that perpetrators are on the ships. “It is therefore crucial to follow up.”
Italy's right-wing ex-Interior Secretary Matteo Salvini demanded an apology from Rackete, who is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration in Italy.
Musk Aiming at Delivery Record for Tesla
Tesla boss Elon Musk has provided his electric car company with a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
“We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees, published by the industry blog “Electrek”.
In his circular, Musk stated that demand was high and Tesla orders could reach about 110,000. The challenge would be to get the vehicles in the hands of customers quickly. To achieve that, Tesla would have to rally as many resources as possible toward the end of the quarter.
This satisfied investors: Tesla shares closed over 6 percent higher. Share prices had not risen by this much in close to four months. In the second quarter, Tesla reached its current delivery record of around 95,000 cars.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious objectives. In 2019, he intends to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures for this and the coming quarter. The least expensive Tesla Model 3 is the most popular, but its profit margins are slim. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US Budget Dispute: Bridge Funding Once Again
The new financial year in the US will start on October 1st without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives and passed a continuing resolution through November 21st.
Although the American Congress and President Trump had agreed on an increase of spending limits for the financial years of 2020 and 2021 in August, the US is once again starting the new fiscal year on October 31st with no spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives and approved a continuing resolution (CR) through November 21st. This resolution avoids a shutdown or partial closure of the federal administration, which would have started at midnight on Monday. President Trump still needs to sign the bill.
Shutdown avoided
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and with the priorities of the financial year 2019, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress could not reach an agreement on the twelve spending bills distributing funds among the various departments and authorities. Therefore, for the moment, the federal administration cannot take advantage of the expenditure framework for the new year, which was raised from 1.3 trillion to 1.4 trillion dollars.
The Democrats have finalized ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending bills reflect the priorities of the Democrats and hardly stand a chance in the Senate, which is dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending bills more or less ready, which will hardly find a majority.
Opinions differ primarily on the allocation of resources for domestic security and border management. In the Senate, the Republicans are evidently trying to exact 12 billion dollars for the construction of the barrier wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are concerned about the planned wall construction and its funding, which was actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall has escalated before, in December 2018, leading to a 35-day shutdown.
Controversy about the wall construction
It remains unclear how the parties can make their positions align. A continuing resolution beyond the 21st of November seems more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending bills in the next seven weeks. A shutdown is another possibility.
In view of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending bills in time and thus the danger of a shutdown, the concept of an automatic process is becoming more popular. Bill S. 1877, aiming to prevent government shutdowns, would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, prohibit all travel by members of Congress and withhold their salaries until the new spending plans have been agreed on.
France Allows Artificial Insemination for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be made available to single women and lesbians: the National Assembly in Paris voted by a large majority for a government bill giving allowing all woman access to in vitro insemination. This should significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The bill still requires the approval of the senate. During the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-winged camp had warned that many “fatherless children” could be growing up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is against the reform as well.
The revision is the core component of a bioethics law which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an “opportunity” for society. It depicted the modern family with children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be carried by social security.
Insemination with sperm from dead husband remains prohibited
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would grant widows access to the sperm of their dead husbands for artificial insemination. “Post mortem” artificial insemination is allowed in Belgium, Spain, and Great Britain. In Germany, there have been cases where women sued in vain for the release of the sperm of a deceased man. Opponents of the Paris motion argued that a child conceived in this way would suffer a "particularly difficult fate”.
Numerous representatives of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition voted for artificial insemination of sperm from deceased partners. They emphasized that a widow would suffer twice as much grief if her husband's death also left her wish to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that, in the future, a widow can be inseminated with the sperm of an unknown man, but not with that of her husband.
Until now, artificial insemination in France has only been allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot conceive children. They needed to be married or living together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy remains illegal.
Artificial insemination in Germany is technically available to all women – but for singles or lesbian couples it is often still difficult.
Compensation for the Climate: Calls for Air Travel Levies for Universities Are Becoming Louder
Universities cause a large amount of air travel. This is why the state intends to introduce a climate levy for universities. University rectors say they do not have the money, but now they are also coming under pressure from within.
Universities should also restrict their air travel. Image: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate levy on air travel for universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors' Conferences had reacted skeptically to the corresponding motion of the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from universities. In a joint statement, PhD students of six universities in Baden-Wuerttemberg and one teacher training college advocate compensation for business flights. This is “urgently needed” as a first step, but at the same time there must be a wider debate about whether air travel can be avoided, their statement says. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision, originally planned for July, remains on hold because the CDU has not yet approved the bill of the Greens.
Russia arrests fisherman from North Korea, again
According to the secret service FSB, the arrested people have been fishing illegally in Russian waters. Ten days before, over 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. Back then there was an exchange of fire between the boat's crew and border guards, during which three Russians and one North Korean have been injured – the fisherman died afterwards due to his injuries. But this time no one has been injured, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic lack of food. The North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastguard patrols the area for the protection of their marine biological resources, according to their own statements.
30,000 squids confiscated
30,000 squids have been found amid new sweeps of the boats, and were consequently confiscated. Additionally, three fish- and two motorboats were brought to Nakhodka and Posiyet in Vladivostok, according to the statement.
Russia’s Fisheries Authority did not issue fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishery Companies in the far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martiynov complained recently about mounting ecological damage due to fishermen from North Korea. They would fish with fine-meshed nets, which are banned in Russia. With those, they would also pull out small animals out of the ocean. Moreover, they would dump them in the sea where the nets would need 200 years to decompose.
No More Than 18,000: US Reduces Annual Refugee Ceiling
The “most generous country in history”: Donald Trump, here in a meeting with police representatives at the White House.
The richest country on earth is sealing itself off against asylum seekers: The State Department in Washington confirms that the ceiling for legal immigration of refugees is being lowered further. In the future, mainly people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis are to be granted asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees. In the financial year of 2020, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be admitted to the country, the State Department declared. In the current financial year, which is nearly over, the ceiling was at 30,000 people.
Over the past few years, the government of Donald Trump has drastically reduced the number of asylum seekers from around the world that it is willing to accept. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, admission limits were much higher.
The planned ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the United States Refugee Admissions Program in 1980. The State Department nevertheless calls the United States the most compassionate and generous country in history, a wording that is strongly reminiscent of the language used by the current President.
“A responsible approach to refugees is one that seeks the eventual return of refugees to their home countries so that they can help to rebuild their own nations,” Trump declared. His hard line in migration policy has been well received by his supporters, but is also severely criticized.
A major point of contention is the border to Mexico, which Trump wants to close off. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump declared a National Emergency. It remains unclear whether there is a connection between the timing of the current measure and the present domestic political developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelensky affair and the possible threat of impeachment.
According to the State Department, the US government will be concentrating on accepting two kinds of refugees- people who are persecuted because of their faith and Iraqis who have helped the US military in their country and are now in danger, as the statement issued by the State Department says. A maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be accepted.
The US wants to ensure that people from the “Northern triangle” of Central America in particular seek asylum in other countries. With that in mind, the United States has recently concluded migration agreements, first with Guatemala, and subsequently also with El Salvador and Honduras, to curb immigration at the Southern US border to Mexico.
Court Orders Release of Orangutan From Zoo
A female orangutan has been relocated from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a sanctuary for apes in the US. “Sandra”, who was born in the zoo of Rostock in 1986, was granted the rights of a “non-human person”, making her release mandatory. The animal was flown directly to Dallas on Thursday evening, not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram ape is not capable of fending for herself in the wild, she will remain at the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. A further 21 orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed there, among them “Bubbles”, once a pet of Michael Jackson’s. Before moving to Florida, however, Sandra will have to spend around 40 days in quarantine at Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After she was born in Rostock, Sandra spent some years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was relocated to Buenos Aires in 1995. The proceedings initiated by animal-rights activists in 2014 to determine Sandra’s basic rights has contributed to the transformation of Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational facility for the preservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineer: 1804 feet in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold succeeded in a daring and bold endeavor on the almost 9,843 foot high “Große Zinne” in the Italian Alps.
Without safety net, double bottom or other assistance, he overcame the 1,804 foot high north face of the Große Zinne in a new record time.
Arnold just needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, solely clothed in jeans, a shirt and without any fear of heights. He undercut the record by almost 19 minutes.
He is now the record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike Benefits From New Online Marketing Strategy
The US sports goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant increase in profit despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. That is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, the group announced on Tuesday. The main reason behind that is the new marketing strategy “Nike Direct”, via which the Adidas competitor can address its customers directly.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in a three month period up to the end of August. The strongest increase in Nike’s sales was 22 percent in China. The group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon therefore also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach of addressing customers directly via the internet or smartphone apps.
Head of Finances Andy Champion announced that Nike will continue to drive the “digital transformation” of the sports goods manufacturer forward and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures; the sporting goods manufacturer's shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Ban Because of Racism
On account of racist comments about soccer professional Juan Jesus of AS Roma, the club in the Italian capital has banned a fan for life from the stadium. The fan abused Brazilian defender Jesus on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and requested that his club take measures. "@officialasroma you already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud of who I am,” wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rome since 2016.
he club reacted late Thursday. It reported the fan to Instagram and the police. Also, the Roma fan was prohibited from attending a match of the club ever again, the club twittered.
Racism is a problem in Italian soccer. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. “We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. The people responsible must be identified and thrown out of the stadiums,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino over the weekend. The reason for his statement were racist chants during the first division match between Atalanta Bergamo and ACF Fiorentina last Sunday.
There have also been debates about the fans of Juventus Football Club. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rampaging Juventus Football Club fans from stadiums. Four of them may not enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police stated. For the others, the bans are valid for four to seven years.
The fans are involved in ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan-groups connected to Juventus. The twelve leaders are accused of, among others, aggravated extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had initiated the investigations by laying charges last year.
The ultra-leaders are involved in the illicit trading of tickets, according to Italian media reports. They are supposed to have held the trade of tickets under “military control” and to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to obtain less expensive tickets.
Generation Z: Are They Really Different From Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, generation Z is political – whole age groups are labeled with catchy terms. A closer look reveals that these terms are full of contradictions. So, how well do these labels describe young people’s attitudes toward life?
“The crabs are coming!” This call officially launched the crab hunting season at the lake of Gucheng in Gaochun and the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, according to the public relations department of the Nanjing-Gaochun district committee.
Gaochun, which forms the Southern extension of Nanjing in the Jiangsu province, is a national environmental zone. The city is the first international “Slow City” in China and at the same time the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city is ideally placed in ecological terms with a mix of “30 percent mountains, 20 percent water and 50 percent fields.” The magnificent natural surroundings of Gaochun offer its inhabitants all the conditions they need to become rich.
The people of Gaochun already started farming crabs early in the 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a formative industry, providing high incomes and becoming an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in the large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and technology-based crab farming. And the city has focused on greater efficiency in agriculture and higher incomes for farmers.
In the past few years, Gaochun has promoted a reform to “distribute power and optimize administration and government services” and has carefully built the service network for “one single location for authorizations, one team for law enforcement, one network for services, one platform for the granting of credits.” Thus, the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for authorizations, services and development.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of its location with its connections to Southern Jiangsu and Southern Anhui. It is using the development zone and its position as an international “Slow City” as a showcase to attract intelligent high-end production facilities, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection companies, culture and health companies as well as ecological farming enterprises that are leaders in the “3+2” sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone encompassing all areas and tourist resorts of national importance. This involved incorporating the ecological and cultural resources of the countryside of Gaochun into the scheme, extensively improving buildings for civic and public services, intensively developing the sectors “tourism +” and “+ tourism”, and promoting high-quality cultural tourism. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict Between Iran and USA: Rouhani Speaks of the End of the Sanctions – Trump Disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions after his return from the UN General Assembly. The United States had promised an end to any and all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Rouhani declared on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said, of course, NO!”
Rouhani describes what happened as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. “And America said, I will lift the sanctions,” Rouhani added. What kind of sanctions were to be lifted was the subject of debate. “And they clearly said, we will lift all sanctions.”
However, this move was not made in an acceptable manner, Rouhani criticized. Given the current sanctions and “the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure”, no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Early this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The reason for this was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This agreement is meant to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the fringes of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe Earthquakes Near Istanbul – Almost 200 Aftershocks
Since Western Turkey suffered two earthquakes in a very short space of time, fear of a disaster is heightening. Thirty-four people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Following the earthquake the day before, there were almost 200 aftershocks, Vice President of Turkey Fuat Oktay said on Friday, causing increasing fears of a disaster.
Fourteen schools in Istanbul were shut down for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8-magnitude earthquake rocked the Marmara region close to Istanbul and caused panic in the million-strong metropolis. The government now intends to appoint a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has been inadequately prepared for earthquakes, said Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu. The city itself continues to ignore the latent danger. Every year, badly constructed homes collapse – worn down, among other things, by the many small tremors that shake Istanbul on a regular basis.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered as shelters in the center of the city have long since been built over. Not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake this August did the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers issue a warning that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake on Thursday was located in the Sea of Marmara at a depth of around seven kilometers, reported the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency Afad. A smaller aftershock a few minutes later caused even more widespread panic on the streets.
The Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu announced via Twitter that there had been no initial reports of injuries or damages. The national public broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their houses in panic. Schoolchildren were led out of buildings for safety reasons in the district of Silivri. Some of the schoolchildren were seen to be crying on the footage.
Istanbul is classified as being particularly earthquake-prone. Underneath the Sea of Marmara lies what is known as the North-Anatolian Fault, marking the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolian tectonic plates. Turkey is regularly struck by earthquakes. One of the most fatal ones was the 1999 earthquake close to Istanbul, which caused the death of more than 17,000 people.
Scientists fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 may be imminent. It is unclear, however, when that earthquake will happen. The earthquake on Thursday once again struck the western part of the country and Istanbul.
Companies are developing emergency plans, private people have what are known as Go Bags packed with everything they need ready to go next to their front doors, and schools are teaching children what to do when the earth shakes. When the next big earthquake is coming, remains unclear.
After his return from New York, the president of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. A few buildings had suffered slight damage. The Mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, was observing developments from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Disaster Coordination Centre (AKOM). He stated that two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer had collapsed.
Aftershock warning in Istanbul
Many social media users reported panic. Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were disconnected. It was more severe than the earthquake on Tuesday, a user wrote. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, warned against aftershocks. He requested people to stay away from buildings that had visibly suffered damage.
The earthquake, according to official statements, happened at 1:59 pm (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, CNN Turkey reported an aftershock with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter Scale.
As recently as Tuesday, an earthquake of a magnitude of 4.6 had shaken the Turkish region of Marmara – it could be felt all the way to Istanbul. Its epicenter also lay in the Sea of Marmara to the west of the metropolis, as the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency Afad had already said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake to hit the headlines that Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Scientists assume that sooner or later, there could be a severe earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that the stress will be released at some point – and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the current earthquake is a forewarning. It is now more likely, he told CNN Türk. “This could be the indication of a larger earthquake,” Ersoy told the broadcaster. “Sooner or later, a great earthquake will happen.”
Just a few weeks ago, an incident had already happened – an earthquake had caused deep concern in Istanbul. A few days ago, there was a severe earthquake in Albania as well – 68 people were injured. There has also been an earthquake at Lake Constance this year.
Congress: New Fuel in the Ukraine Conflict
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair, in which President Trump is accused of abuse of power. The Democrats feel encouraged on their way to impeachment proceedings. The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower against Trump and his telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president contain important clues for investigations against the President. Trump once again sees himself as the victim of a “witch hunt.” What’s more, he questions the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger trapped in lavatory – plane rerouted
Due to a passenger getting trapped in the lavatory a United Airlines flight has been rerouted. During flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco the toilet door was jammed, the airline told US media.
During an unscheduled layover in Denver on Wednesday afternoon (MDT) the woman was finally released from the tight cabin. According to other passengers, US media wrote, she was trapped for about an hour. For the continuation of the flight to San Francisco the passenger had to change planes.
A video distributed on the Internet, which according to US media is said to be from flight 1554, shows how several people are trying to free the woman. “We’re currently working on opening the door, ma’am. We'll get you out of there soon, okay?”, a man can be heard. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive any compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes a Brexit novel
How does an author like Ian McEwan cope with the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it – and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story The Metamorphosis, the British bestselling author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel The Cockroach will be published in German on November 27, the publisher Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) informed. It is about the metamorphosis of a man named “Jim Sams”, who was ignored or hated in his former life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to execute the will of the people and is fiercely determined not to let anything or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "As parliament is closed down so that the government cannot be challenged at a crucial time and ministers lie about it shamelessly in the old Soviet style, and when many Brexiters in high places seem to crave the economic catastrophe of a no deal, and English national extremists are attacking the police in Parliament Square, a writer is bound to ask what he or she can do. There’s only one answer: write.” McEwan’s novel Machines Like Me about artificial intelligence was just recently published this spring.
Kafka’s story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself “transformed into a huge insect”. He gradually becomes excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. “Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that is upside down”, Diogenes Verlag said.
EU Invests 9.5 Million Euros in Austrian Railway Infrastructure
11,200 railroad cars in Austria and Hungary are being equipped with whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains. Also, sections of the train tracks between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are being modernized and electrified.
According to EU authorities, this should make travelling more comfortable and lower CO2 emissions. The funds stem from the EU infrastructure fund “Connecting Europe Facility”.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
The German travel business Thomas Cook cancelled all trips up to and including October 31st, 2019, one day after filing for insolvency. Travels “can not be started due to bankruptcy law concerns”, the company informed on Thursday evening.
Affected by this are bookings through brands like Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen, and Air Marin, which are either partly or fully paid for. The company did not give a statement concerning trips starting on November 1st, 2019 or later. Further actions are being examined in accordance with the insolvency insurance, it said.
In Germany, Thomas Cook came into the pull of the bankruptcy of its parent company and applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The corporation, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours, and Bucher Reisen amongst other, employs around 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer now wants to transfer money to hotels again
This Friday foreign hotels hosting Thomas Cook guests should receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments for the hotels are tied to the condition to not ask vacationers for extra payments, according to Zurich.
Based on booking information and without further submission of invoices, hotels in the vacation destinations should receive 50 percent of pending payments now, a Zurich spokesperson told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. “This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas Cook’s guests are not being asked or compelled for individual payments of hotel bills”, spokesman Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurer reacted to reports of hotel guests who, according to their accounts, were forced to pay for their accommodation by themselves. Some had to front more than 1000 euros. The German travel association DRV and the Federal Association of Consumer Advice Centers (Bundesverband der Vebraucherzentralen) criticized this sharply.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook travellers from Germany are in transit. Zurich Germany secured vacation and return trip for the Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook incorporations in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The announced payments for hotels from the Zurich-Insurance are just helping the travelers still abroad. It does not look good for Thomas Cook customers still planning to go on vacation. Late Thursday evening the company said that all trips up to and including October 1st would be cancelled. This also applies for already paid reservations.
The company did not give a statement concerning trips starting on November 1st, 2019 or later. Further actions are being examined in accordance with the insolvency insurance, it said. In principal the insurer Zurich is also responsible in this case. The sale of new tours is on hold. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented through the Kaera Company. Customers can get information on the Kaera website about possibilities of reimbursement and to file claims through a web form.
Prince Harry destroys land mine in Angola
For a while Prince Harry continued the endavour of Lady Diana. In West Africa he is now following in the footsteps of his mother.
Clad in a blue flak vest, the British prince Harry triggered and detonated a land mine in Angola.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust in Dirico, he created the ignition circuit in front of TV-cameras. At a safe distance the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing further damage. Even though the Halo Trust destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decade-long, bloody conflict, there are still more than 1000 mine fields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip Harry wanted to follow in his mother Diana’s (1961 – 1997) footsteps in the city of Huambo. With the same demolition expert who accompanied his mother back in the day, he intended to walk the same path that she walked back then. The pictures, on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared mine field, went around the world. She demonstrated support for the Halo Trust as well.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) are on a ten day long African trip, which started in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stalled Brexit Negotiations: The Risk of a No-Deal Remains Acute
Originally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had committed himself: there would be no third delay in the Brexit negotiations. But which statements by the polarizing Briton have stood the test of time? The latest ruling of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom hangs over the towhead like the sword of Damocles. His suspension of parliament in order to wrestle his Brexit-course through to the exit date was annulled early this week. A law passed by parliament obligates Johnson to bring about an extension of the bilateral talks in the case of failed negotiations with the EU by October 31st. This has always been categorically ruled out by Johnson.
Boris Johnson still thinks a deal is possible
However, Johnson seems to be feeling the pressure. Meanwhile, during a visit to a hospital, he hinted that he would support an extension of negotiations in the case of non-agreement by the end of October:
You know, we will obey the law.
But we are confident that we can come out on October the 31st.
And the best way to do that is to get a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out on the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Around six weeks remain for the EU and British representatives to prevent a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union without a deal. But the latest talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October is currently rather difficult to picture. If the Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed delay of the exit date will become effective. However, the opposition does not trust the word of the Prime Minister. It fears that, in the case of a no deal, he will somehow still be able to push through a Brexit.
US Authorities: More Deaths Caused by E-Cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. Furthermore, there have also been 805 confirmed and presumed injuries in this context, said the US health authority CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", more than 900 people have been affected, of which 500 cases have been confirmed. What causes the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, there has been no such increase of lung damage. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fears of Renewed Protests in Egypt Are Growing
The videos of Mohamed Ali were shared millions of times in online social networks. In them, the building contractor and actor, who lives in Spain, is demanding a “people’s revolution.” For today, Friday, he has called for further protests against president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whose critics accuse them of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass rallies with a million participants at central locations in the country.
Security authorities are on alert. An increased police presence was already noticeable in central Cairo. A number of subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked off. Throughout the past few days, the police had increased road checks and, in some instances, searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with several hundred participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt in many years. The response of the security forces was correspondingly strong. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), close to 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested – only because they were at the “wrong place at the wrong time,” HRW reported, citing the lawyers of some of those arrested.
Moreover, the organization criticized the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo is blocking website and online services to prevent further protests against el-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, when he overthrew the democratically elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially sentenced in the past few years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs Returns From Greenland Expedition
The polar scientist Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was greeted on his arrival in the port of Hamburg by, among others, skipper Borris Hermann, who sailed environmental activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic in his racing yacht “Malizia”.
Together with a team of scientists, Fuchs had been documenting the effects of global warming on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in his sailboat “Dagmar Aaen”.
The polar scientist said that the Fridays for Future movement was a blessing. He had been waiting for years for the younger generation to speak out. For decades, people have known that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many people were acting as if there were a planet B.
Fuchs said, “What is happening at sea often happens outside the public view.” He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. In the course of the expedition, they measured the thickness of Greenland’s glacial ice with a drone and fished for microplastics with a net, among other things, he stated.
For his “battle for a more sustainable and respectful use of the oceans”, the polar scientist from Bad Bramstedt received the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. “Arved Fuchs is a great example for all of us who care about the survival of the oceans,” said skipper Boris Hermann at the award ceremony. “He is a witness of the changes that have happened in the Arctic over the last decades.”
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists Paid 430 Euros for Noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant’Angelo in Rome: this seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. They paid the bill, which included a tip of 80 euros, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which prompted heated reactions.
“Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We urge the police to investigate whether this is a case of fraud,” a spokesman from Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, demanded according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The proprietor of the restaurant responded promptly. The Japanese women did not just order spaghetti but also fresh fish, the owner justified himself. However, this was not mentioned on the receipt. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal as well, the proprietor mentioned.
One phone call to Ukraine and everything is ruined? US President Donald Trump could indeed be confronted with an impeachment trial after the turbulent revelations of the past few days. The Democrats now want to look into this as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives – there is talk of weeks before a decision would be made.
Supposedly, at the beginning of the scandal is the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusations of the whistleblower, who made the conversation public with his complaint out of his concern for national security and democracy in the US, are monstrous: the President abused his power to pressure the government of another country into influencing the 2020 elections. In doing so, he took advantage of the dependence of Ukraine and tried to blackmail its government into taking action against one of his political opponents.
The essence of this plan can also be seen in the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky that has been published since, although it does not reproduce the full text. The phone call on July 25 is just one episode in a much bigger story which is centered not only on Trump, but also on his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
From a public perspective, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani’s travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet the recently elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well how delicate his intentions are. “We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation, which we have the right to do,” he tells the newspaper. One could argue that it is inappropriate, but “there is nothing illegal about it”. Giuliani wants Ukraine to start investigations for which there is hardly any basis – “because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and could turn out to be very helpful for my government.”
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to be infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies focused on Trump's opponent during the 2016 elections: Hillary Clinton. She has conspired with agents in the Ukraine, critics said back then to construct an excuse for the Russia investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never meant to be taken seriously.
This is exactly the kind of investigation that Trump would talk about so prominently on the phone with Zelensky in July. Giuliani’s and the President's version are: former Vice President and currently most promising Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, in his role as the Obama administration's representative to Ukraine, had pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian Attorney General at the time, Victor Shokin. This was in order to stop the investigation of the gas company on whose board his son Hunter Biden was a member. Biden senior had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt activities of his family.
In reality, things happened somewhat differently. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General be dismissed, the investigations against the gas company had already been concluded. Hunter Biden was never directly involved. Shokin himself was also accused of deeply corrupt conduct, and the US government was by no means the only Western partner pressing for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations into the company.
Service disruptions at Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp: social media pages are down
Users throughout the world have reported massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Germany, Great Britain and Spain have been particularly affected. Users have reported to the website allestörungen.de that since about 3:30 p.m. the social media pages have repeatedly been failing to load. Instagram has also been issuing error messages that content cannot be loaded. WhatsApp, too, seems to be affected by the problem, if, thus far, not to the same degree.
Instagram & Co. often affected by service disruptions
This is not the first case of massive disruptions this year. Back in March and July the services were out of action for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users are using Twitter in particular to air their dissatisfaction.
Polish Scientists Rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were en route in an inflatable boat, several miles away from their base, when their engine failed. They were lucky in their misfortune – it took the Chilean rescue helicopter less than an hour to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 am we received the message, shortly before 10:00 am we took off, and about 20 minutes later we were above the inflatable.”
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977; 19 scientists work there. The thoroughly chilled scientists were safely returned to their research station.
Warning: Never Charge Your Smartphone Wirelessly
Handy but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely convenient, it should not be used.
Since several new smartphones that support wireless charging have been released on the market recently and are selling very well – especially the new iPhone 11 models – we would like to remind readers of a study carried out in early July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is indeed convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperatures harm battery
Scientists are warning against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the University of Warwick, it is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significant increase in heat generation. If a mobile phone is being charged normally via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees Celsius within three hours. When charging wirelessly, even if the smartphone was perfectly aligned on the charging pad, the scientists always measured over 30 degrees Celsius. If the mobile phone is positioned slightly to the side of the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn increases power consumption.
Capacity and service life
According to the scientists, temperature is a deciding factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree is relevant. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity but also durability. Its service life is therefore shorter. Thus, the scientists recommend that smartphones should always be charged via cable. Since replacing the battery in modern smartphones is always quite expensive, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of battery replacement for all iPhone models.
Handy
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on an appropriate charging pad – these have now been installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars, and the battery is charged without getting cables tangled or fiddling with plugs. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transfer) has become an established global standard which even Apple supports, there are virtually unlimited possibilities. Nevertheless, according to the scientists, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic photographer: 13 Eight-thousanders in six months
By his own account, a mountaineer from Nepal climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the summit of the Manaslu in Nepal and set a new record, according to his expedition's organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his endeavor “Mission Possible”. He already made international headlines: He took the picture of mountaineers queuing on Mount Everest that went viral this spring.
The picture of the huge crowd sparked a debate on stronger security measures for the 29,028 feet high mountain, the highest summit in the world. Eleven mountaineers died within a few days in May, during their ascent.
Climbing the 14th eight-thousander may become a problem for Purja: currently Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One of the reasons cited for this is bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wants to negotiate with China to enable his ascent.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
There is also a pregnant elephant amongst the dead animals, a police spokesman said on Friday. “We assume the elephants have been poisoned.”
The four carcasses have been found in a sanctuary close to the famous rock fortress Sigiriya, which attracts many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. To find the cause of death, an autopsy has been mandated.
Almost 2,000 elephants are being killed each year in Sri Lanka. The culprits are usually farmers, on whose lands the elephants feed themselves. At the same time around 50 people are being killed by elephants annually. This usually happens when animals travel through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, about 7,000 elephants are still living in Sri Lanka. In theory, killing an elephant carries the death penalty.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker Stena Impero leaves the seaport of Bandar Abbas, after more than two months detainment by Iran. This has been announced by the Bandar Abbas maritime administration, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian revolutionary guards detained the tanker operating under the British flag on July 19th, based on allegations of having violated of maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook Under Criticism
The economic committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook. The main concerns are the salary packages of the board members, as well as the question of why the British government denied financial support during the corporation’s battle for survival. “Our interest is in the oversight of the corporation, as well as external auditors,” committee chairman Rachel Reeves explained in London. “Apparently, we are dealing with a bad example of management greed.”
Role of Genes Overestimated in the Risk of Intestinal Cancer, Experts Say
An increased risk of intestinal cancer through genetic predisposition has apparently been overestimated. This is the conclusion of researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits have a larger impact than previously supposed. This is of significance in calculating an individual's risk of intestinal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Musk Makes Tesla Shares Rise
This is what Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time), as published by the industry blog “Electrek”. In his circular, Musk stated that demand was high and Tesla orders could reach about 110,000.
The challenge would be to get the vehicles in the hands of customers quickly. To achieve that, Tesla would have to rally as many resources as possible toward the end of the quarter.
This satisfied investors: Tesla shares closed over 6 percent higher. Share prices had not risen by this much in close to four months. In the second quarter, Tesla reached its current delivery record of around 95,000 cars.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious objectives. In 2019, he intends to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 cars. This involves six-digit figures for this and the coming quarter. The least expensive Tesla Model 3 is the most popular, but its profit margins are slim. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Does the British Government Want to Circumvent the Brexit Bill? Johnson Remains Reserved
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the bill recently passed by Parliament against a no-deal Brexit. When asked the question on Friday, he told journalists only that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticized this as a "capitulation law" that would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major expressed the suspicion that Johnson may try to use political chicanery to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the law taking effect until the time after Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
Johnson said that he wanted a treaty with the European Union. “We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31st, and the best way forward is with an agreement.”
Iran Appears to Be Increasing Its Uranium Enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on the European contracting partners in the conflict over how to rescue the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, European nations are demonstrating incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to specific actions,” Rouhani said on Thursday during a press conference on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they would not stand by their pledges, he promised “further steps” away from the agreements of the treaty, negotiated with difficulty in 2015.
The background of all this is the international treaty to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US unilaterally withdrew from the treaty in 2018 to use “maximum pressure” to force Iran to change the course of its Middle East policy, which was perceived as aggressive. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tighter restrictions and has reverted to tougher sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently reacted to this by increasing its uranium enrichment, which is limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using centrifuges installed in early September with uranium or has at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA information, Iran is also preparing to assemble over 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal, thus abandoning the Iranians to the cost and burden of the oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani speculated. But there would be continued talks, hopefully leading to a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
The convoluted situation has certainly changed since an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September. On Monday Germany, France, and Great Britain shared the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, Houthi insurgents, supported by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack in Yemen, but the US classified the claim as false. “We had nothing to do with it,” Rouhani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
“Whoever makes such accusations must provide evidence,” Rouhani said. But during the talks with him at the UN General Assembly, European leaders were not able to do so. Instead they had only referred to the fact that the insurgents in Yemen would not have been able to execute such an attack. In the past few days, Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted before talks with US President Trump would become a possibility, Rouhani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to change their policy to one of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet From Another Star Crosses Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has only happened once before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What started out as an assumption has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space has been named 2I/Borisov after the person who discovered it and is attracting interest from astronomers around the world.
The widely-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo observatory in Crimea – with a self-made telescope only 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object found traveling through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a unique opportunity to gather insights into alien solar systems before it disappears forever. First observations show how the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, according to the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. “The current velocity of the comet is high, around 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is considerably higher than the typical velocities of objects circling the sun,” Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency NASA reported in an announcement.
According to the analyses, the comet is traveling on what is known as a hyperbolic trajectory, which leads it out of our system, and it is undoubtedly of interstellar origin, the International Astronomic Union (IAU) announced. The IAU is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial objects. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar comet received the name 2I/Borisov, after having initially been catalogued under the number C/2019 Q4. The first part of its name, 2I, indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our Solar System.
Astronomers are lucky: contrary to 1I/‘Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was spotted during its approach. This gives astronomers several months to investigate. “The object will reach its brightest luminosity in mid-December and will be observable until April 2020 with mid-sized telescopes,” Farnocchia explained “After that, you will only be able to observe it until October 2020 with bigger, professional telescopes.”
Several observatories already targeted the visitor. A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who already lead the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined that the diameter of the celestial object is between 2 and 16 kilometers. Images of the Gemini observatory on Hawaii showed the comet's distinct tail.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already obtained a first spectrum from the interstellar comet, which is like a fingerprint of its chemical components. “The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our system – which suggests a similar composition,” IAC researcher Julia de León reported. This observation indicates that comets in our and in other solar systems are formed in similar processes, de León's colleague Javier Licandro added.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of researching specific processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits will occur. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be intercepted by a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency ESA.
By 2028, the agency plans to station a three-part space probe called “Comet Interceptor” in a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth. It will either be looking out for an untouched, new comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First Landing on Beijing's New Mega-Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic: the first passenger plane of China United Airlines landed at the new mega-airport to the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be handled at the new airport, and by 2025, the figure should reach 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. China's latest prestige project is also called “starfish”, due to its six-armed building design.
The complex has four runways for arrival and departure, with plans to extend the number to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the much smaller airport in Germany's capital city, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed repeatedly. Whereas in Beijing, the first passenger plane was able to land after only four years.
New Supersonic Aircraft to Fly by 2030: From London to Sydney in Four and a Half Hours
From London to Sydney in no more than four and a half hours – this is the dream of the United Kingdom Space Agency. The US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying that a special propulsion system (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, SABRE), being developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, will make this supersonic flight, planned for 2030, possible. “This is technology that could definitely deliver that,” agency director Graham Turnock told CNN. “We're talking the 2030s for operational service, and the work is already very far advanced.”
To drive the project forward, the United Kingdom Space Agency intends to work together more closely with its Australian counterpart. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for transporting passengers, the Concorde covered the route New York-Paris, which took three to three and a half hours, from 1976 until 2003, when it ceased operation. In the year 2000, an accident occurred at take-off at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. All 109 passengers died. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin revealed plans that they have partnered with the US space agency NASA to develop a supersonic aircraft, the “X-Plane”. Virgin Galactic is also developing a similar aircraft.
Reaction Engines writes on its homepage “SABRE will make the world smaller through high-speed point-to-point transport.” The SABRE engine could be used for efficient travel at Mach 5 – five times the speed of sound. Furthermore, such aircraft could also operate outside the Earth’s atmosphere, creating the “next generation of truly reusable space launch vehicles.”
Turmoil in Washington: Trump Wants to Track Down Anonymous Whistle-Blower in Ukraine Affair
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
“I want to know who provided information to the whistle-blower,” Trump told staff members of the United States Mission at the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person in question is close to “a spy” and those have been dealt with in the past “a little bit differently” than today.
This was considered an attempt at intimidating the whistle-blower. Technically speaking, the event was not public, but several US media circulated audio recordings of the speech on Friday. The Democrats reacted with outrage to the statement of the president.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday that they were preparing impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their accusations are based in particular on the written complaint of an anonymous secret intelligence agent, who is making serious charges against Trump and his government headquarters. The whistle-blower's account had been made public on Thursday following strong public pressure.
As part of his job, the whistle-blower claims to have received information from several government employees, according to which the US president “is using the power of his office” to get another country to intervene in his favor in the 2020 US elections.
At the center of the accusations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his colleague to conduct investigations that could damage his political rival Joe Biden. These involve past business dealings by Biden’s son Hunter in the Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead in the race for the democratic presidential primaries in the 2020 election.
The whistle-blower also accused the White House of cover-ups with regard to the Ukraine phone call. Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation secret. As usual, an electronic transcript had been made. On instruction from White House lawyers, after the conversation, the transcript was removed from the database usually provided for this purpose and was instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistle-blower is not publicly known. The “New York Times” reported that it was a CIA foreign intelligence officer.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the “so-called whistle-blower” had distributed second-hand information which had been proven incorrect. Therefore, there could not even be any whistle-blower or spy at all.
But the way Trump spoke in New York about the whistle-blower's sources caused outrage. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was concerned and complained that Trump's statement was once again undermining the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and his associates have been underway for months in various committees. In light of the Ukraine accusations, the Democrats are now driving investigations forward with renewed force in order to start a possible impeachment trial against Trump.
“The whistle-blower has given us a road map for our investigations,” the chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence in the House of Representative Adam Schiff said. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of a false depiction of facts and again demanded the resignation of the committee chair. Trump insults Schiff frequently and demanded his resignation months ago.
In a statement released on Friday, more than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy sectors, most of whom worked under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, backed the investigation launched by the Democrats for possible impeachment proceedings. Should the accusations prove to be true, this would be “an unscrupulous abuse of power” by Trump, the statement said.
There is no exact schedule for further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could indeed initiate what is known as impeachment proceedings. But the decision for the actual removal from office is made in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans constitute the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. So far, no US president has been removed from office through an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs to be Cut "Gradually"
VW's plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This is causing concern for the car manufacturer's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of 10 billion euros by 2 billion euros by 2023. 500 million euros should already be saved this year.
A key to this are staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between company and works council in 2016 foresees the loss of 14,000 jobs just in Germany by 2020. Basically, the rule is that a job can only be cut at the car manufacturer when it is effectively proven that it is no longer needed. Furthermore, a job guarantee is in effect until 2029.
As our newspaper learned from sources in the works council, jobs in production which were actually not to be cut will be "gradually" disposed of via another way - avoiding the official path. Allegedly, such regular jobs vacancies are often no longer filled.
The works council has no opportunity in these cases to force positions to be refilled. In the meantime staff are missing on many fronts, workloads are increasing, and concerns are growing about automobile plants being gradually bled dry. This increases concerns that automobile production will be further withdrawn from Germany and Europe, as it is cheaper to produce in other parts of the world. VW has merely stated that "As agreed upon, adjustments to levels of employment will occur in line with social acceptability along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and steer new projects centrally. This should help lower costs and also accelerate the decision making process, with an aim towards raising productivity and therefore competitiveness. Head of Production Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In particular in times of uncertainty from Brexit, to a potential trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
This way forward has already borne fruit. For example, this year saw the first decrease in production costs per vehicle compared to the previous year since 2013. Tostmann announced in front of journalists that the production costs for the Golf 8 to be unveiled in Wolfsburg on October 24 will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Precise figures relating to production time were not given by VW; our newspaper's information suggests for the Golf 7 around
20 hours
In our region, the main Wolfsburg plant is the only VW plant which produces automobiles. The plants at Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg there is a rule of thumb at VW that annually 800,000 automobiles are required to be assembled for the plant to achieve a satisfactory level of profitability. The year 2018 however saw a level at Wolfsburg of only around 700,000 vehicles - a result of falling demand for diesel and problems with moving over to WLTP, the new test procedure for fuel consumption and exhaust.
As head of production Tostmann had already announced the previous year, Wolfsburg should "expect" one million automobiles coming off the production line in the long term. With the concentration of Golf production at the main plant, this should be possible, as the Zwickau plant will lose its Golf assembly due to the location's switch to electric car production.
Further, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) will be produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of Golfs and Tiguans have recently been decreasing. Expectations are thus resting on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, it will for the time being remain Wolfsburg's bread and butter automobile.
Forced Into Prostitution With Voodoo: Human Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria were compelled to take ritual oaths, smuggled into the Ruhr areas and forced into prostitution. Because of this, six suspected human traffickers have been sent to prison.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria have been sentenced on Friday in Bochum to suspended sentences and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months. The accused had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. To compel them to obedience, the would-be emigrant Nigerian women had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest in their home country.
The victims were between 17 and 21 years old. With the help of Libyan traffickers, they were brought across the Mediterranean to Europe in inflatable boats. However, their dream of a better future remained unfulfilled. Upon arriving in Germany, they were distributed among various brothels to work off the supposed trafficker costs of around 25,000 euros. Their entire wages were taken away from them.
The defendants – four men and two women – had admitted during the trial that they had smuggled in the young Nigerians and subsequently distributed them among brothels. “The work was hard on the women, both physically and psychologically,” said Judge Isabel Hoffmann when sentencing. “Some of them were thoroughly disgusted.”
The defendants were convicted for commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, procurement and aggravated forced prostitution.
UFO demands negotiations with Lufthansa
During its ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Corporation the Union for Flight Attendants, UFO, again threatened strikes.
If the company should not return to the negotiation table, the union will “give notice about industrial actions in the LH group on October 14”, UFO chairman Daniel Flohr stated on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings refused for months to return to collective bargaining with the UFO - which also entails the question if the union lawfully cancelled collective agreements with the Lufthansa.
In this point the UFO sees itself strengthened by the Frankfurt labor court. Lufthansa wanted to determine that the collective agreements have not been cancelled. The court rejected the petitions. The company confirmed the decision and examines the possibility for appeals. “I think it’s unlikely that a second court sees the case completely differently”, UFO chairman Flohr said.
In August Lufthansa submitted an application to the state labor court in Frankfurt, to legally examine the status of UFO as a union. The company argues that the union did not appoint a board of representatives for months and hence is not able to fulfill its role as social partner.
This was preceeded by a tough leadership dispute in the branch union during which several members of the board of representatives, as well as the advisory board resigned. Among them is long-standing head of the union Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended an already commencing strike ballot on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
To date, Saudi Arabia has not really been known as an international tourist magnet. However, this is set to change. The Persian Gulf state aims to introduce new visa requirements.
Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future with the new visa system. The Commission for Tourism says that they want to increase the number of international and local visitors to 100 million annually.
The Commission’s chairman Ahmad al-Khatib says, “The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourism is a historic milestone for our country.”
It has been difficult for tourists to travel to Saudi Arabia. Visas are usually issued only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or to visitors with relatives in the desert country. The ultraconservative kingdom hopes that the new rules will generate more income from tourism. Riyadh states that it wants to reduce its dependency on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil facilities in the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abqaiq as well as the Khurais oil field. As a consequence, national oil production dropped sharply, and oil prices rocketed. It may well take several weeks before the oil production in the kingdom returns to its normal level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber Busy Preparing for Wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. On Thursday (local time), the model posted several party photos on her Instagram stories, where she can be seen in her white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a hen party in Los Angeles, according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including ones with banana prints, on Instagram and asked his followers: “Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding.” According to media reports, the celebrity couple plans to get married in a church this coming weekend.
The Biebers got married a year ago in a New York registry office. They did not have a large celebration then.
Recently Hailey explained in an interview with Australian Vogue that the two of them had found common ground after problems at the beginning: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two Casualties in Plane Crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small airplane in the Western part of the Czech Republic. The wreck was found on Friday in a forest area close to the town of Mecin, said the police. The victims were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the aircraft since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent out a distress signal via GPS. A military helicopter was involved in the search. The cause of the accident remains undetermined. The crash site lies about 30 kilometers south of Plzen and 100 kilometers north of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's tree species face threat of extinction
Along with parasites, diseases and non-native species, unsustainable forestry and the growth of towns are the causes of the threat, as reported by the world nature conservation union IUCN in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the numbers of all 454 known types of tree found in Europe. 265 of these are not to be found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are endangered. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus threatened with extinction.
The IUCN divides species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "critically endangered", "threatened with extinction" "extinct in the wild" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 species of animal and plant worldwide as endangered.
Mountain ash and horse chestnut endangered
In Germany, the mountain ash (Sorbus) is particularly endangered, one of the authors, David Allen, told the Deutsche Presse Agentur. "Most are endangered because their numbers are in any case small, either due to change to or weakening of their habitats."
Things also look bad for the wild horse chestnuts. They have been deemed "endangered" since 2017, level two on the IUCN scale. Along with a fungus, the greatest danger is represented by the horse-chestnut leaf miner. It has been spreading since the 1980's from southeastern Europe across the whole continent and has barely any natural enemies. The IUCN estimates the number of wild horse-chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to be fewer than 10,000. This estimate does not include those trees to be found in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists have at the same time compiled new European red lists for mollusks, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of mollusks and mosses, along with almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened according to the IUCN. This is due above all to the destruction of wilderness, invasive species, agricultural practices and climate change. Mollusks like snails play a key role in recycling nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report demonstrates that the situation for many overlooked and undervalued species is precarious, species that form the backbone of the European ecological system and contribute toward a healthy planet," Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe office, says. "We must limit the effects of man on our ecological system and make protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake near Istanbul: 34 reported injured
In the latest earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. There were no fatalities reported. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, with 14 schools in Istanbul being closed for safety reasons, said the Turkish vice-president Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were reported to have been damaged. Since the earthquake the previous day, there had been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake, measuring 5.8, shook the Marmara region near Istanbul on Thursday and created panic in the multi-million inhabitant city.
Oktay announced that the government wanted to set up a commission to have the country better prepared for earthquakes. Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said that in the past 20 years Turkey had not been adequately prepared for earthquakes.
Istanbul is considered particularly prone to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian tectonic plates.
One of the worst earthquakes measuring 7.6 occurred in 1999 near Istanbul. Its epicenter was to be found in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people lost their lives.
On Tuesday an earthquake measuring 4.6 had already shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities appealed to inhabitants to keep away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira Perform in Halftime Show
The Latin-pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will be leading the halftime show of the next American football final, the Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. “It doesn’t get any bigger than this!” was Shakira’s comment under a picture of herself and Lopez. She said that she was incredibly excited about getting on the Super Bowl stage. The Super Bowl is happening in Miami on the 2nd of February.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 – ever since she saw Diana Ross flying off into the sky. “And now it's made even more special not only because it's the NFL's 100th anniversary, but also because I am performing with a fellow Latina. I can't wait to show what us girls can do on the world's biggest stage.”
Shakira announced that she was so honored to be taking on one of the world’s biggest stages in the company of a fellow female artist to represent Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and all over the world. “And to top it off, on my birthday!” The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that this was the first time the two “queens” would be on stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jenifer Lopez was born in New York; her parents are from Puerto Rico.
The struggle against declining viewer numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most viewed television broadcasts in the US, even if viewer numbers have been dropping in recent times; this February, the spectacle in the US attracted the smallest number of spectators in over a decade. Still, on average, there were close to one hundred million people watching.
There had been uproar around the halftime show in the run-up to the previous Super Bowl: According to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B declined to perform last February given the controversy around how quarterback Colin Kaepernick was treated. In the end, the pop group Maroon 5 led the show; the reviews were not particularly kind.
Kaepernick, a quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers at the time, had kneeled during the national anthem before games in the 2016/17 season, in protest against police brutality and racial inequality. His protest triggered a movement, and numerous players copied the gesture. This caused an uproar, and US president Trump sharply criticized the mostly Afro-American football stars. Kaepernick has been a free agent since March 2017 and has not played in any NFL games. He accuses teams of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Thomas Cook bankruptcy: hotels to receive money from insurance
Some banks may well end up finding the bankruptcy of tour operator Thomas Cook expensive, according to a press article. There is a risk of large write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Those affected also include Credit Suisse, the Financial Times writes in its Friday edition.
Banks including Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse will have to carry out write-downs on their books to the tune of up to 1.8 billion pounds (around 2 bn euros), according to the report. This had been suggested by estimates from the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors with outstanding claims would have to reckon with write-downs of 900m to 1bn pounds and lenders between 550m and 825m pounds. The actual amount to be written down would tend rather towards the upper end of the scale, an expert told the newspaper.
The actual amount creditor losses will come to will be revealed with the conclusion of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to these proceedings did not express particularly much hope. The around 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in Great Britain for example are "aged" and many of its properties are in poor locations. The most money could be retrieved with the sale of airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, the source continued.
Rackete Presumed to Have Brought Suspected Murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have transported men to Italy that have tortured and killed people in Libya. “We cannot rule that out, but we have no reliable information ourselves,” the speaker of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Rugen Neugebauer, told the press agency dpa.
Other migrants claimed to have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people. The suspects had been arrested in the reception center of Messina in Italy. Neugebauer stressed that refugee organizations cannot verify who they let on board their ships. “They do not come equipped with passports.”
On June 29, Carola Rackete illegally transported migrants into the port of Lampedusa, ramming a boat of the Italian Financial Police in the course of doing so. The three suspects are thought to have arrived there that same day as well. The captain is under investigation for facilitating illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government of Huawei
The head of the US internet authority, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network equipment manufacturer Huawei.
"We believe the risks to be too high", Pai told the newspaper Handelsblatt regarding the construction of the new 5G mobile communications network.
China has a "national security law" that requires every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow directives of security organs.
The law in force "also forbids companies from informing third parties about any such requests", the FCC head added. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has in the meantime agreed to demand a "declaration of trustworthiness" from suppliers.
Berlin wanted initially to attempt to mitigate the risks, for example through technical solutions, the Handelsblatt reported, citing its own sources.
Pai doubts that this is possible. "The 5G technology is not made up of hardware alone."
"It is precisely the software that is important to keep equipment up-to-date. This software is made up of billions of lines of code that change with time", Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine that a governmental body anywhere would be in a position to check every single update in real time in order to detect security risks", the FCC head continued.
He accuses Huawei of having close links to the Chinese state.
"The ownership structures are opaque. The corporation of employees which supposedly owns the company is not exactly independent of the government", Pai told the Handelsblatt.
The US allegedly have evidence that members of the government have been planted within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemical Factory in Northern France on Fire: Schools Closed
Residents hear explosions at night. A gargantuan wall of fire illuminates the sky above a chemical factory in northern France. Hours later the fire is extinguished – but clean-up operations could last for days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the city of Rouen in northern France on Thursday, schools and daycare centers in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, as precautionary measure, these facilities would not open, the prefecture responsible informed. The Department of the Interior requested citizens to stay indoors as much as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were asked to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, the prefecture informed. There was still a risk of the smell spreading even after the fire was extinguished, the prefecture tweeted. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were part of the operation at the site of the fire.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the plant of the Lubrizol Company, a producer of oil additives. The production plant is located just a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to what is known as the Seveso category of high-risk sites subject to special surveillance. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso near Milan in Italy.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told news channel BFMTV that so far no "high toxicity" had been found in samples. A contamination of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams against contamination had been built in the river, the prefecture explained.
Authorities reported that the fire broke out on in the early morning around 2.40 am The cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: “Germany Must Invest Now”
The Minister of the Economy and Finance of France, Bruno Le Maire, has called for Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the euro zone.
“Germany must invest now- the earlier the better,” said Le Maire on Thursday evening while presenting the French budget for the coming year.
The economy within the euro zone was weakening, the Minister warned.
“We cannot wait to make the necessary decisions until the economic situation deteriorates.”
Those countries that still had scope within their budgets must act, said Le Maire, with a view to Germany, among other countries.
France did not have the scope, the Minister added, referring to the substantial government debt of his country, which exceeds 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French national debt must be “stabilized” and “reduced,” said Le Maire.
France has repeatedly launched appeals to Germany to increase the level of public investments to stimulate the economy. In return, German politicians have regularly requested France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday stipulates tax relief of over nine billion euros for households
This is one of the ways the French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vests movement. New debt should drop to 2.2 percent, after the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to play games? Johnson dodges questions on Brexit tactics
British prime minister Johnson sharply criticizes "capitulation bill" passed by parliament.
The parliament is back, and a bill obliges the British prime minister to avoid a chaotic Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still make use of a loophole. When asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician avoided an answer.
The British prime minister Boris Johnson is keeping his options open on whether he wishes to follow through on a hard Brexit irrespective of the bill recently passed by parliament seeking to prevent exactly this from happening. In reply to a question on the subject, Johnson merely replied in front of journalists that his government would abide by the law in place.
The bill stipulates that the government is required to request a postponement of the date of leaving if by mid-October no agreement with the EU has been reached. Johnson criticized this as a "capitulation bill" which made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
The former British prime minister John Major had on Thursday suggested that Johnson might resort to "political chicanery" to avoid the bill. The premier could use a procedural trick that would delay the bill's being passed until after EU withdrawal. Johnson said he was working toward a deal with the European Union. "We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement".
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings declared that he regarded the political challenges surrounding Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU exit would come about. "We are enjoying it, we will win, we will leave (the EU), no worry," Cummings said at a book presentation according to the British newspaper Daily Telegraph.
Cummings, who led the Vote Leave Brexit campaign during the EU referendum in 2016, now serves as chief strategist in the British government at Downing Street. He is believed to be behind the uncompromising policies that have led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin – they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the greatest rock photographers. But it’s not always about the glamorous. The photo book The Polaroid Diaries (Taschen) delves deeply into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the book The Polaroid Diaries at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders lead singer Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a pre-Instagram glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family, a celebration of Linda McCartney’s legacy as a fiercely committed artist and of the instant magic of Polaroid film.”
Linda McCartney, who studied Fine Arts at the University of Arizona until she discovered photography, always had her camera with her. She took thousands of polaroid pictures, and a few hundred of them are now being published for the first time in “The Polaroid Diaries”.
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the 70s through the late 90s. “She wanted real moments,” the art critic Ekow Eshun wrote in his foreword. And of course, there is always one person that takes center stage: Her husband Paul, perhaps how you have never been seen him before.
There he is, dancing with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, on the telephone in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing misshapen moonboots. The McCartneys were certainly an extraordinary family, but one that led a perfectly normal life on their farm in Southern England or in Scotland outside of the spotlight. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that, as a baby, she slept in a bed her father had fashioned out of old potato crates. And things weren’t always tidied up at the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaroid camera captures the immediate moment. The images of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
“It’s just that one click. You’ve got to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you’ve got to snap it at exactly the right moment,” says McCartney. And she had the gift of capturing exactly the right moment. “She just knew that she had it,” says Paul in the Eshun Essay.
The lighting, the composition, the detail and the colors are just right, which makes The Polaroid Diaries not only an entertaining photo book for Beatles fans, but, beyond the anecdotal, also provides great aesthetic delight when landscapes sometimes appear as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the recently reissued Beatles album “Abbey Road”, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will keep buying oil and gas from Iran"
In spite of sanctions against Iran, Turkey wants to keep importing oil and gas from its neighbor. Turkish president Recep Tayyib Erdogan said in an interview, published on Friday, that Turkey could not cancel the import of oil and gas from Iran.
"We will keep buying our natural gas there," said Erdogan in New York where he attended the UN general assembly.
Erdogan however admitted that Turkey faces issues importing Iranian oil since several companies backed out of the business, due to "American threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will, "especially concerning this issue and also regarding many others, continue its relationship with Iran," said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since leaving the international nuclear treaty with Iran, the US is pursuing a policy of "maximal pressure" against the Islamic republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly running a nuclear program and disregarding the treaty.
Their sanctions caused a crash of Iranian oil exports as well as a severe economic crisis in Iran. Over the last months, tensions in the gulf region have increased significantly.
US Government Plans to Restrict Refugee Admission
The US government plans to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The annual upper limit for a resettlement program is to be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, the US Department of State explained on Thursday. This amounts to a reduction by 40 percent.
The State Department explained that the US would still be committed to aid refugees. But the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the US government plans to concentrate on the admission of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their religious beliefs, and Iraqis who have helped the US military in their country and are now in danger, according to the statement of the State Department. By contrast, a maximum of 1,500 refugees will be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current upper limit of 30,000 is already a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the limit was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations were horrified by the announcement that the limit was being lowered. “This is a very sad day for America,” said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would further damage its leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to drastically restrict immigration to the US – both legal and illegal. For the coming budget year, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - “Close to a Spy”
US President Donald Trump has accused the informant in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever provided the whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian President is "close to a spy," said Trump according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. Several US media reports agree on this.
According to these reports, Trump was speaking to employees of the American UN mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial occurrences in the White House, he answered: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”
Observers think this last remark could be an allusion to the death penalty. Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of trying to intimidate witnesses. Furthermore, they were an attempt to obstruct an investigation by Congress into possible impeachment proceedings, wrote the chairs of the committees for Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform.
In a now published complaint, the whistleblower accuses the President of having used the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it concerns the controversial telephone conversation between him and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky during the summer. Trump suggested in the conversation that Zelensky initiate investigations in the Ukraine against his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It remains unclear who the whistleblower or his or her informants are. However, the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is presumed to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat capsizes: baby and small children drown in Aegean
People repeatedly attempt to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. In the process, the often far-too-small boats regularly capsize. A rubber dinghy capsized leading to the death of seven migrants, including five children.
Near the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants lost their lives when their rubber dinghy sank. The victims include a baby as well as four other children, as reported by the Greek coast guards. Four children, three women and five men were apparently saved by the crew of a nearby ferry.
The victims apparently also include a human trafficker, as reported by the local Chios news portal, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey that morning. They had attempted to reach the Oiousses island group to the northeast of Chios. Oinousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is as of yet unknown which countries the migrants originate from. Hundreds of migrants are currently leaving Turkey for the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean, mostly in boats that are far too small. According to the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR, last year 174 people lost their lives on this sea route.
The Who Break Off Concert
A concert in the US by the rock band The Who came to an abrupt end due to lead singer Roger Daltrey being indisposed. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, he lost his voice. During the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should quit while I'm ahead."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and said, “Daltrey cannot actually speak now.” He promised the crowd that the band would give them their money’s worth at a make-good concert still to be scheduled.
The Who cancelled performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. They will be made up for at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old fellow band member Townsend are the only remaining original members of the band. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Freeze in rentals: WeWork sends a chill through property markets
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office tenant.
In just a few years, WeWork has gone from being a small startup to the driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company finds itself in a crisis. Landlords have income to the tune of billions to worry about.
The crisis surrounding the office space renter WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world’s largest real estate markets. The company ditched founder Adam Neumann as CEO several days ago, put off its planned IPO and started selling off subsidiaries and assets including its private jet for top management in order to gain financial breathing room for the coming weeks and months. Further, the British Financial Times amongst others has reported that WeWork has suspended new rental contracts with immediate effect. This has suddenly removed the largest tenant of office space from markets including New York and London.
WeWork rents large office spaces long-term and lets them short-term to members in smaller units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large companies. Until now, WeWork has burnt money with this business at breathtaking speed. During the past year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars on a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs on just the new large spaces are estimated to have risen to 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit losses, the new corporate management has applied the emergency brake and stopped as of immediately the leasing of new office space.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has in the meantime concluded rental contracts with durations of up to 15 years, generating liabilities of more than 40 billion dollars. These gigantic liabilities may not only turn into a problem for the company itself as well as its investors, but also for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, during the past 24 months WeWork has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive property markets in the world. WeWork’s new contracts alone caused a demand for offices in New York that was higher than all the new space coming onto the market during this period. As written by Alpert in Business Insider, without WeWork’s expansion, the amount of empty office space in the US metropolis would have risen during this period. The situation is similar in London, where in the meantime WeWork runs several dozen office locations in top areas.
In the British capital, too, balance could significantly shift without the aggressive startup expanding further. WeWork is the main tenant in an office block in the middle of the financial center, bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for around 100 million euros.
Many landlords have invested heavily in remodeling their properties in line with WeWork requirements. Should WeWork fail to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would be forced to write off part of their hoped-for billions in earnings. Regardless, access to the (in any case) tight WeWork reserves is not open to them; the leasing of individual locations by WeWork normally occurs via specially founded subsidiaries (so-called special purpose vehicles) with parent company liability only within narrow bounds.
Russia Once More Arrests Numerous Fishermen From North Korea
The Russian coast guard again cracked down on North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a further 262 poachers fishing illegally in Russian waters have been arrested, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB said on Friday, according to the agency Interfax.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. The border guards had been fired upon, and three of them were injured. There were none injured this time, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were sailing in Russian territorial waters. The Russian coast guard patrols the area to protect their marine biological resources. They found 30,000 squid during new inspections. Additionally, three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated and shipped to Nakhodka and Posyet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Nowosti, the coast guard recorded more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
This year, the Russian fishing authorities had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans, after complaints by local businessmen. In 2019, thousands of fishers from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested, according to media reports.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the far eastern region of Primorsky Krai, complained recently of the high ecological damages caused by North Korean fishermen. They used close-meshed synthetic fishing nets, banned in Russia. These nets also pull small animals out of the sea. Furthermore, they simply disposed of the nets in the sea, where they take 200 years to decompose. The ships themselves did not meet hygiene and technical requirements either.
During the arrests the week before, three members of the Russian coast guard had been injured, according to Moscow. An injured North Korean later died of his wounds, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and subsequently a second one after it opened fire on them.
US Imposes Entry Ban on Former President Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. In a statement issued on Thursday, the US State Department justified this with Castro’s involvement in “gross violations of human rights”. As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he presided over a system in which thousands of Cubans were being arrested arbitrarily, with over 100 political prisoners.
Furthermore, as head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was an accomplice to human rights violations in Venezuela by supporting the president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. “The disregard of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the continuing crises in Cuba and Venezuela,” tweeted the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump issued entry bans against members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others. A bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging in Venezuela for months. The US has imposed an entire series of sanctions against Maduro’s government in order to bring Maduro to his knees and to help opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guadió to power.
Cuba is said to be one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of Cuban physicians. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also deployed a number of secret service agents in Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest climate protests ever, thousands of people aim to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
For the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning campaigns and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. They will most likely start in New Zealand and Australia, due to time differences, and then continue across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg intends to participate in a mass rally in Montreal. Demonstrators also aim to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
Following the record participation last week, it remains unclear how high worldwide response will be this Friday. Thunberg herself remained optimistic. “Last Friday over 4 million people striked for the climate. This Friday we do it again!” she wrote on Twitter, adding, “170 countries and 6383 events so far in #weekforfuture.”
In Germany in particular, the protests were very popular. A good third of all demonstrators around the world – approximately 1.4 million – participated in 575 German cities. A list by the movement shows that rallies are planned in at least 65 cities this time. People are aiming to take to the streets for the climate both in large cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Last August, at the age of 15, Thunberg sat down in front of the Swedish parliament to call for stronger action on climate protection by the politicians in her country. Within a short period of time, this turned into the Fridays for Future movement. Participants in the climate protests are mostly schoolchildren and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together they demand that politicians step up their fight against global warming and the threat of a climate catastrophe. In particular, global warming needs to be limited to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison to pre-industrial times, as specified in the Paris climate agreement.
Barely a month ago, Thunberg arrived in New York after a two-week transatlantic sail on an ocean-going racing yacht. There, she has most recently taken part in climate protests and summits at the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional speech at the United Nations, appealing strongly to the heads of state and government of the world. On Wednesday, in her home town of Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize by the Right Livelihood foundation for her commitment to better climate protection.
Russia Prohibits Smoking on Balconies
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on their balconies. This is part of a change in fire prevention regulations. “These apply to smoking as well,” said a speaker of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on Thursday in Moscow, according to the news agency TASS. The prohibition will take effect on October 1st.
Offending smokers can expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette causes a fire, the fine is higher. The ban also covers burning candles, according to the Ministry. It is also no longer permitted to grill meat skewers on the balcony.
Blow Against Cyber Criminals – Investigators Eliminate Server
For the first time in the battle against crimes on the internet, German investigators have eliminated a major server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
Thirteen people in all are suspected of having operated a computer center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, hosting numerous websites through which criminals operating internationally conducted their business.
This was announced by the Attorney General in Koblenz. On Thursday evening, seven suspects were arrested in the course of a major operation. The Darknet is an isolated part of the internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among others, the operators of the world's second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, called “Wall Street Market”, which investigators had broken up in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers in late November 2016 was controlled through a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General.
It is the first time that such a web hosting service has been identified in Germany, it was said. A web hosting service provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
During the seizure operation, supported by special units such as the GSG9, searches were conducted in Germany and neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. The investigators intend to provide further details at noon.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protest yet, thousands of people want to take to the streets again for climate protection.
For the conclusion of an international week of climate strikes, the movement Fridays for Future planned further activities and rallies for more environmental protection in dozens of countries around the world.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, among them cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also smaller communities and towns like Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia, or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a mass rally in Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protests | Who Are Actually Thunberg’s Backers?
Courage and a sense of justice are important virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. It is all the more surprising that, of all people, a 16-year-old girl is holding a mirror up to today’s power-seekers. But what is behind all this? Is it willingness to help or the clever marketing of a climate activist? Historic masterpiece or a manipulative tactic for its own sake?
For one thing, Greta Thunberg gets the masses moving and causes young people stand up for a better and more climate-friendly world. Historically speaking, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to gain the support of children and young people. Back in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne felt predestined to bring about more justice in the world. He also managed to win over a group of children. He convinced them to cross the sea to reach the promised land, just as Greta Thunberg recently made her way to America on board a sailboat.
But is there a downside? Why do we need a “We Don't Have Time” share in order to save the planet? In addition, Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Quite incidentally, her mother has published a book, which sold widely, thanks to her famous daughter. Even longstanding followers of Greta Thunberg were somewhat indignant at the latest PR-show, or rather, the trip on the boat was considered exaggerated by many of her followers. Their concern is not unfounded, as the action was very effective in the media around the world, and lots of money is flowing in the wake of this extraordinary operation.
This is where opinions differ: Is it morally right to become rich in the course of saving the world? Is it still legitimate when certain people work together with brokers while rescuing the world? No matter which stand one takes, a critical and considered point of view becomes ever more important in a democratically run society, as democracy thrives on differing opinions and discussions. That is why it can certainly make sense to critically question the seemingly worthy undertakings of certain trendsetters.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Travels Through Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently traveling through our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently traveling through our solar system – and it is only the second of its kind.
Garchin/Washington – For some time researchers have only assumed, but now they have confirmed: a comet from a different star is crossing our solar system. It was named 2I/Borisov, after its discoverer, and is currently keeping astronomers around the world busy.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by an amateur astronomer in Crimea
The comet was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borrissov in Crimea. He watched the sky with his homemade telescope, and further observations confirmed his first suspicions. It is indeed an unknown comet which does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind has been was sighted during its flight.
This is a great opportunity for astronomers to gain insights into foreign solar systems up close. It appears that the comet resembles those of our own solar system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving out of our solar system on what is known as a hyperbolic trajectory.
The comet was already sighted before its approach and can be observed for several months
But until then, astronomers can observe it in detail. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov was sighted during its approach, which means it can be observed from Earth for several months. “The comet will be brightest in mid-December and can then be seen with mid-sized telescopes until April 2020,” explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency NASA. “After that it can be observed only with bigger, professional telescopes until October 2020.”
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights into comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to first insights, the comet is estimated to have a diameter betweem 2 and 16 kilometers. At the same time, the celestial body seems to resemble our comets, because, as IAU researcher Julia de León put it, its spectrum is similar to that of our comets. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems are formed by processes similar to ours, de León’s colleague Javier Licandro added.
But the observation goes beyond individual insights. That two objects of this kind have already been discovered in just two years may facilitate new ways of researching certain processes in other solar systems.
Time and again asteroids keep researchers busy. Only recently, a giant asteroid rushed past Earth, coming dangerously close.
“Totally reprehensible”: Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
It is getting lonely around Boris Johnson. First his younger brother leaves his cabinet and now his sister clearly criticizes the belligerent language of the premier as “tasteless”. He is not the brother she knows.
“Capitulation”, “Fraud”, “Contract”: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and arms himself further – at least verbally. This is met with outrage during questions to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons this Wednesday, and now more critics spoke out including dozens of bishops and his own sister, Rachel Johnson.
The famous journalist and author told Sky News her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of Brexit should be “hanged, stretched on the rack, tarred and feathered”. She believes this to be greatly reprehensible. She does not recognize this version of her brother, said Rachel Johnson who ran for the “Change UK” anti-Brexit party in the European Parliament elections.
She was especially appalled by her brothers mention of Jo Cox, an EU friendly House of Commons member who was killed by a neo-Nazi a few days before the Brexit referendum in 2016. It would be best for her remembrance, if the Brexit is pushed through, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. “It is very vulgar to refer to a MP murdered by someone who screamed ‘Britain first’ ”, Johnson’s sister criticized. The perpetrator had apparently come from the right-extremist wing, which felt reinforced “by this kind of language”. It appears very crude to everyone mourning for her.
The widower of Cox criticized the Prime Minister sharply as well. “It makes me sick when Jo’s name is being used”, he tweeted. The best way to honor her would be, to stand up passionately and determined for what you believe – independent of what belief you have. But never “demonize the other side”. He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks were more likely.
Just a few weeks ago Boris Johnson’s younger brother resigned as State Secretary and Tory MP. “During the past months I was torn between my loyalty to my family and the national interest – it is an unresolvable tension”, Jo Johnson explained his move.
Even the church met Johnson’s language with sharp criticism. Reported by the “Times”, all 118 bishops and arch-bishops of the Church of England criticized the language, that is “not worthy of this nation”. They explained in a joint statement: “In the past days, the language in debates as well as outside of the parliament was not acceptable. We should speak to each other with respect.”
Shakira und Jennifer Lopez Performing at Super Bowl
The NFL is sending a strong message in the 100th year of its existence: in the halftime show of the forthcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latin roots are performing, which promises “an explosion of fun and energy.”
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) are putting on the halftime show of the forthcoming final of the US National Football League (NFL), the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to be, in a way, next to J.Lo, representing the Latino community that is such an important force in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the US National Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place on February 2nd in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the Southern tip of Florida. Shakira (“Waka Waka”) comes from Columbia, Lopez (“On the Floor”) is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl has two women performing this year. That they have two Latinos performing this year," Lopez added. It sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises an “an explosion of fun and energy” for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed great hits with songs like “Waiting For Tonight” or “Let's Get Loud”, and later released songs in Spanish as well. Lopez also works as an actress. Starting in November, she will be on screen in German cinemas in the drama “Hustlers”.
Shakira became known as the star of a telenovela and as a singer in Colombia. She achieved her international breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single “Whenever, Wherever”.
The announcement of the halftime guests is always highly anticipated. Many consider this year’s selection to be a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least due to the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have been met with wild excitement. As a rule, more than 100 million television viewers watch the final. It is now also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversies arose in the run-up to the event. The reason was the conflict concerning quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest of police brutality against black people, had refused to stand up during the national anthem. He was harshly criticized for this by US president Donald Trump, among other people. In solidarity with Kaepernick, a number of musicians declined to perform at the Super Bowl, among them Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 performed was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber puts Egypt's ruler under pressure: Mohamed Ali currently rather prefers to remain abroad.
The two men who may influence whether blood will flow again on Egypt's streets both spent last week abroad. One of the two glided back to Cairo's airport on Friday. The country's president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi returned from the UN general assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 removed Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the country's first freely elected head of state, from power had spent a pleasant time in New York. US president Donald Trump had praised Sisi's approach towards political Islam and not lost a word over human rights violations at the Nile. This was during a week in which Egypt's security forces had arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. Sisi said in front of state TV's microphones at the airport that he had "no cause for concern." The Egyptians "won't let themselves be led astray."
Leading astray is what, in the president's view, the other man who currently shapes happenings in the streets is attempting. Mohamed Ali remained abroad, where he is beyond the reach of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he attempted to set foot on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known to a minority of Egyptians as an actor. Today, his is the defining voice that dominates political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tea rooms. With his Youtube channel Mohamed's Secrets, Ali is calling on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in pretty rough language. While the people are going hungry, the president is "indulging in luxury and having fine new palaces built." Ali accuses the army leadership, upon whom Sisi relies to maintain his rule, of corruption and self-enrichment. Having been in business for 15 years with these very people in his second profession in the construction business, he would appear to know precisely what he is talking about - this at least is the opinion many Egyptians have, as indicated by the currently soaring number of clicks.
After last week saw, for the first time since his grab for power, thousands demonstrating against Sisi's rule and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures in civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians being arrested, Ali called for a "march of millions" for this Friday. That so many people would really risk going out onto the streets was unlikely, but there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, with people accusing el-Sisi of corruption and demanding his departure. At these protests, police used tear gas and fired rubber bullets. These videos could not initially be verified. Security circles let it be known that the police had put an end to the demonstrations.
Massive police presence was reported on Friday in the town of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where last week demonstrators had torn up a portrait of the president. Security forces set up checkpoints in the town and approaching roads. In Cairo, several underground stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work," with most roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 Revolution, being blocked off. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the toppled Muslim Brotherhood leader Mursi barricaded themselves in 2013 until the army opened fire on them and killed up to 800 people, another approach was used to avoid the dissatisfied coming together. At this very place Sisi's future party wanted to stage a large event for the president.
These measures caused Mohamed Ali to change his tactics. "Our goal need not be Tahrir Square," Ali said into his video camera in Barcelona. "Let us not clash with policemen." That is not to be understood as a retreat - "the whole of Egypt is Tahrir Square."
When Internet Providers Promise Too Much
If your Internet connection seems to be slower than your internet provider advertised, there are several ways you can look into this.
When you sign an internet service agreement, you do not have to blindly trust your provider’s performance claims. As a customer, if you feel there is an irregularity, you can check the speed yourself.
After all, the promised data transfer rates are part of your agreement and should therefore be achieved, says the Consumers' Center in Bavaria.
If your connection always seems to be much slower than the provider advertised, there are several ways to test this. For instance, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed upon in the contract.
“The tests of the providers, however, follow provider-specific standards and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated,” the Consumers' Center in Bavaria points out on its website.
If the connection is significantly slower than advertised, customers can set the provider a reasonable deadline - usually 14 days - to provide the promised service. This is best done by registered mail.
If that has no effect, even after repeated requests, customers can cancel their contract and possibly even claim damages. In the absence of success, however, the only remaining option is legal action.
First Senior Republican in Favor of Investigation
The Governor of Vermont is the first senior Republican to call for an impeachment investigation against US president Donald Trump. “I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established,” Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistle-blower incident before taking action – impeachment proceedings can lead to the president being removed from office.
Scott said that he was not surprised when it was revealed that Trump repeatedly urged the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to look into the interventions of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in the Ukraine. Trump has been watching Biden “over the years”.
To date, Republicans have been holding back on criticism of Trump in the whistle-blower incident; few have expressed their discomfort. Scott’s remarks are a first indication of unease in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump’s policies on several occasions, for instance, relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for every fan of Spider-Man- it was announced late August, that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways. Tom Holland's Spider Man therefore would not be part of the “Avengers” universe anymore. It was completely unclear how the movies around Tom Holland would be continued.
Now the surprise: After “Spider-Man: Homecoming” and “Spider-Man: Far from Home” Spider-Man is receiving an additional, final movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Several US media outlets unanimously reported this. According to this, the opening day is decided as well- in the USA the movie is supposed to start on July 16th, 2021.
The “Screenrant” journal cites Marvel boss Kevin Feige: “I’m excited that Spidey's path can be continued in the MCU. Myself and everybody at Marvel studios is delighted that we can carry on … he is the only super hero with the ability to partake in different universes, since Sony continues its work on the Spidey-Verse. You never know what the future will hold.”
But how did the sudden good news come about? Apparently Sony made an offer to Marvel. According to trade magazines, the Disney Corporation, which owns Marvel, wants to contribute to upcoming movies for a share in revenue of 30 percent. However, this information is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the finale of “Suits”
After nine seasons, the American series “Suits” has reached its grand finale. In the last episode, there are many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And a charming tribute was given to the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who took part in the series for many years. Alert – the following paragraphs contain spoilers for the finale of the series.
First off: Duchess Meghan does not return as Rachel Zane for a final farewell, at least not in any new scenes. Instead, a number of retrospectives show some of the most memorable scenes with the present Duchess, for instance the moments of the failed and the successful weddings with Mike or how she greets him after he completed his jail sentence.
Her real husband, Prince Harry, is also mentioned in passing in the “Suits” finale, in a wedding scene, of course. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) starts walking down the aisle to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachel Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Harvey, taken aback, asks the groom whether he really wanted to wear a morning coat, and snidely remarks: “Louis, you’re not the Prince of England.”
In the Aegean Sea: A Baby and Four More Children Die in Boat Accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a boat full of refugees capsized in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the accident, the Greek coastguard revealed on Friday. The nationalities of the victims were still uncertain.
The boat sank close to the Greek island of Oinousses, between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the Eastern part of the Aegean Sea. According to the UN refugee organization (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year. The German Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, has now announced that he intends to visit both countries.
Seehofer said on Friday that he intended to “inquire about the refugee situation” together with his French colleague and the EU commissioner in charge. Subsequently, in Athens, he aimed to find out more about the “administrative problems in Greece” in order to help tackle them.
On Friday, a speaker of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofer, EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Unusually large numbers of migrants are still arriving in Greece from Turkey. The Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection reported that on Tuesday alone, 654 people crossed over to the Greek islands.
Is the Turkey-deal still working?
The increasing numbers raise doubts as to whether the 2016 agreement between the EU and Turkey is still operational. The agreement stipulates that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants arriving illegally in Greece via Turkey. In return, the EU agreed to accept one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each Syrian deported.
Processing the asylum applications is, however, progressing slowly on the Greek side, due to a lack of personnel. The Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection reports that 29,400 people are holding out on the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros und Kos. The situation is at its worst on Lesbos: A camp with a capacity of 650 now houses 5,200 migrants.
Never before have there been so many since the EU-Turkey refugee deal entered in force in March 2016, according to state radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health care system to the test. The changes to the climate will "quite certainly" be one of the greatest challenges for the health care system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Cardiac Society. High temperatures and large changes in temperature over a short period of time are a challenge for the cardiovascular system and lead to more heart attacks. Above all, people with cardiovascular illnesses, older people and those with diabetes are affected.
Green Politician Must Answer for Embarrassing Photo Slip-Up
Green party leader Elizabeth May in the election campaign – is that why the cup was manipulated?
In the photo, the Canadian Green party leader is holding a reusable cup in her hands. But it has now become apparent: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It remained undetected for quite some time - and has now finally been noticed. Green party leader Elizabeth May never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hands. On the party’s website, she was depicted in a photo with the cup in her hand, talking to members of the public. However, the photo had been published and distributed to the media previously – and there the cup was a simple (paper) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green party leader must answer for photo slip-up
The National Post accused May of manipulation and the party of producing fake news to appear more credible on the subject of “environmental protection”. This was in the midst of the election campaign for the House of Commons in which Trudeau is facing difficulties due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in social media and fueled the discussion about fake news. A user shared a side-by-side comparison of the two photos and wrote: “The Greens manipulate a photo of their party leader to hide her disposable cup.”
May expressed her shock and assured in her blog that she knew nothing about this change. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original photo: She herself, talking to members of the public, a cup in her hands. That cup, she rectified, is made of bamboo. She always has it with her. A spokesperson of the party said that the only point was to introduce the party logo into the picture, not to hide anything. Only part of the picture is now visible on the website.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did this. “I don’t want to call them stupid on television, but there was nothing there to hide,” she said and asked her overly enthusiastic team: “If they’re going to Photoshop, couldn’t they do something with my face and make it look a little younger?”
The German Greens have also been hit by maelstroms for their use of disposable plastic and travel by air; however, their pictures were not photoshopped. The head of the Green Party in Bavaria, Katharina Schulze, for instance, was eating ice cream with a plastic spoon on vacation, as reported by merkur.de*.
Influencer wants upgrade for free: lifelong ban for flights
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng had been assured an upgrade via mail. But when she asked for it during check-in, she was not allowed on board – and was banned for life from Cathay.
Many flight guests dream of an upgrade to business class. Sometimes they get lucky and the employees at the check-in offer a change from economy class for free.
This case shows though, how you should not do it. A self-declared influencer actively asked Cathay Pacific airline for a free upgrade. On Instagram Jaqueline Ng has more than 65,000 followers. On May 30th she flew to Taiwan; on June 7th she flew back to New York.
Employees denied the upgrade on the outbound flight, even though she showed an email from Cathay Pacific allegedly promising an upgrade. The mail supposedly came from a marketing associate of the airline. However, the airline accuses Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for the long haul flight again. This time, she showed the same email but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they asked headquarters and indeed, the employee who supposedly wrote the mail denied any correspondence with Jaqueline. This has been confirmed by the email system, in which the messages did not appear.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline’s tickets and imposed a lifelong ban on flights with Cathay Pacific. She had to buy a new plane ticket to Taiwan for USD 1,400 .
The influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a corporation that represents consumer interests. Even though Cathay reimbursed her the price for the original ticket, Jaqueline demands the reimbursement for the new ticket as well.
But as long as Jaqueline cannot submit the metadata of the email, the case is clear. According to Cathay, the influencer committed fraud and is banned from future flights. The terms and agreements of the airline also state that they don not need to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline will not accept this and is now hiring a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell rapidly by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Most recently a barrel of oil (42 US gallons) of the Northern Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars – around 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price for a barrel of the American sort West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the market slide was a report of the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia allegedly has agreed to a ceasefire in four regions.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi-Arabia in mid-September had brought five percent of the global oil production to a halt. The Houthi rebels, allied with Iran, had claimed responsibility for the attacks in civil war-torn Yemen. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would mitigate the tensions in the region.
"Should an agreement be reached, you could focus on growth and demand concerns," Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank told news agency Bloomberg.
Oil prices continued their slide of the past few days. A week ago one barrel of WTI oil amounted to almost 59 dollars, and Brent to nearly 65 dollars.
Bloomberg recently reported faster repair works on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attacks in mid-September, citing inside sources. Accordingly the production output reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving towards regular amounts.
Recently there have been several news releases, backed by inside sources, that addressed quick developments in the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco regarding the repair works. Experts pointed to Saudi Aramco’s plans to become listed and to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time there seems to be an easing of tension between Iran and western countries. The British oil tanker Stena Impero is now on its way to leave port, after being detained for more than two months by Iran. The crew is now preparing to depart, while the ship still lies at anchor, Erik Hånell, head of the shipping company told Swedish broadcasting in a text message.
However, the USA announced a relocation of defensive missiles and soldiers against the Iranian nemesis of Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the USA and the United Kingdom considerably drove up oil prices in the past weeks.
Allegations Against Trump Intensify
In the controversy around the potential abuse of power by President Trump, the White House has been accused of a cover-up. According to an anonymous informant, a number of leading government officials seem to have gone to great lengths to prevent access to the transcript of a controversial telephone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy around the end of July. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of a cover-up operation. Trump called it a “witch hunt”.
North Korea Thinks Third Summit Between Trump and Kim in Doubt
North Korea has expressed doubts over a third summit in the nuclear dispute between ruler Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The purpose and chances of success of such a meeting are doubtful due to the lack of progress in the implementation of the arrangements made at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday according to the agency KCNA.
The US has done nothing so far to implement the resolutions of last year's summit, the advisor of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said. He also criticized the tighter US sanctions and the joint military exercises by the US and South Korea. But he still hopes for a “wise” and “brave” decision by Trump to enable another rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he first wanted to know what a third summit with Kim could achieve before he agreed to it. Negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program came to a standstill after the second summit between Trump and Kim failed in Hanoi last February. In June, the two met in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Korean states. There, they both agreed to revive the negotiations, but without much success so far.
Prince Harry: weapons manufacturers should assist in mine clearing
Wearing a blue splinter protection vest, Britain's Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed a mine in Angola. Close to a camp belonging to the British Halo Trust near the settlement of Dirico, he set off the ignition circuit. At a safe distance the detonator then exploded. With a view towards having Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of live TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons but have not helped in their clearance to commit themselves to doing so."
Pound Under Pressure - Interest Rate Reduction Expected
British pound under pressure
In light of an imminent interest rate reduction, the pound is decreasing in value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculations that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon be reducing its interest rates are putting pressure on the pound sterling. On Friday, the British currency dropped by up to 0.4 percent down to 1.2269 dollars.
The sales were triggered by central banker Michael Saunders’ statements. He brought up the topic of an interest rate reduction, even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as uncertainty could adversely affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This was a surprising statement, as Saunders is normally known to be an advocate of restrictive monetary policies, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokerage house ActivTrades.
Just last week, the Bank of England pointed out how the Brexit-wrangling is putting a strain on the economy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on October 31, if need be without a withdrawal agreement.
What’s more: The British Prime Minister is taking a big risk with his provocations. But this may be to his benefit, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: more Russian tampering proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being tampered with, as confirmed by David Howman, once director of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) and current head of integrity at the World Athletics Council.
At the start of the world athletics championship, new details of the doping scandal in Russia are emerging - and they are destroying what little credibility Russian sport had won back at the start of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the samples demanded from 2012 to 2015 to the world anti-doping agency (WADA). It has now emerged that they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic cheating was uncovered in Russian sports. The WADA then banned the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA) for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the international arena. The International Olympic Committee allowed some 270 athletes of the country to take part at the 2016 summer games in Rio after individual examination under a neutral flag. And at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian sportsmen and sportswomen were at the start. They were also permitted to be a part of world cups in various sporting disciplines: in summer the football World Cup was even held in Russia with the host nation as a participant.
Positive findings missing
The following September saw the WADA lift the RUSADA ban, while demanding access to the laboratory and the aforementioned samples. The data should provide insight into the scale of covering up doping cases in state-backed doping. They should help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The head of the independent Athletics Integrity Unit at the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory were tampered with. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We had to check whether the task force had received the right data", said David Howman in an interview in Friday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data which the WADA received from a whistleblower, and [the data] which it received in January from the Russians." Many positive findings which had been mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
World Championships unaffected
This is confirmed in the IAAF approach: the athletics federation is the only organization to maintain Russia's ban. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo testing.
At the start of this week the WADA had already raised the issue of tampering and demanded that Russia reply to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now faced with the RUSADA again being excluded and in the worst case being banned from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
